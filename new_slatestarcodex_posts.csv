"Wellness Wednesday thread for February 20, 2019

The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives. It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and if you should feel free to post content which could go here in it's own thread. You could post:

- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

Populist sounds downright positive: it sounds like it's a popular politician if anything.

The rationale is that they are indeed leveraging rage (which is in general bad, or at least negative), and are surfing on a wave (which implies risk of wipeout and general lack of control of the underlying movement itself), and it's a very show-off type activity that certainly does require skill and care, but it is not one of deliberative substance or actual problem solving - people surf for fun, sport & because it looks cool, not to substantively improve the world (cue the links to all the surfing based fund raisers and do-good activities, ok, fine, now stop ruining my metaphor please ;)

"I've found websites claiming chlamydia ""can't"" be transmitted through kissing, but that seems like possible hogwash given that:

- in at least [this one old study](https://jcp.bmj.com/content/48/7/658.short), chlamydia was found in the throats of 17.6% of people who were positive genitally and said they had practiced oral sex;

- I've found no studies showing that it *cannot* be transmitted with kissing.

What I'm thinking of is the following:

1. Person A has chlamydia genitally.

2. Person B performs oral sex on person A and acquires chlamydia orally.

3. Person C acquires chlamydia orally by making out with person B.

4. Person C tests negative for chlamydia because it's not in the urine, but has it orally.

5. Person D receives oral sex from person C and acquires chlamydia genitally.

6. Person D now mysteriously has chlamydia ""from nowhere"".

This seems to me something on which we should have info, but I have not been able to find it. Is anyone aware of any studies?

"A lot of the western hysteria over Social Credit is deeply misguided and probably Sinophobic. Ideologies of the left, right and whatever Kaczynski was have long complained, Satanic Mills onward, about the atomized and empty nature of urban life; seas of strangers, towering high-rise apartment blocks, a life spent meeting and socializing and then forgetting, countless missed connections, little-to-no communal social fabric. Most 'solutions' that *don't* involve completely resetting society (the Khmer Rouge approach, anprim armageddon ala *Industrial Society*, religious re-awakening, the literal end times) are built around an escape to some form of pastoral haven: the Montana commune, the Benedict Option, Jonestown. Social Credit offers another way out. It is not revolutionary, in that it does not seek to overthrow the existing economic system, end urbanization, totally reshape interpersonal relationships in cities or effect massive, immediate change in some other form. It seeks merely to forcibly implement a level of communal social trust in a society of more than a billion people in which this is [sorely necessary](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-02/18/content_16230755.htm). 

Technology cannot recreate the intimate social fabric of the organic traditional community, but it can use negative reinforcement to force positive interpersonal interaction, pro-social behavior and faith that the other person involved in a given exchange will do the right thing because the *social consequences* thereof are bad. 

In the traditional, small society, an old lady notices you putting your feet up on the bus in your village, she tells grandma who mentions it when you come visit a week later. A shopkeeper tells your uncle he sings in the Church choir with that he spotted you and your friends shoplifting cigarettes last week. You clean up your dog's shit on the path in the park because your best friend's sister's wedding party is having a picnic there tomorrow. If a crime is committed by a group of teenagers one night, the police have at most a few dozen suspects. Someone with an extremely aggressive dog who has attacked and injured someone else's pet becomes a feature of local gossip, faces negative social consequences. A grocer who overcharges, or who has a reputation for inappropriately flirting with high-school aged female customers does the same. None of these interactions are possible in a major city or even sizeable town, where individuals effect countless negative environmental or social changes upon each other. This is because many of the above aren't crimes, or at least aren't more than the petty crime to which major urban police forces devote little effort. This is the problem that fully-integrated social credit (coupled with universal ID, contactless payment and seamless data sharing between government agencies) solves. 

Someone who subway CCTV catches putting their feet up on the opposite bench is identified via facial recognition and has to pay double fares for three months. The annoying teenagers partying outside your house until 3am on Tuesdays don't just get a shitty police caution, they get a letter from the federal student loan agency saying that $500 in fines will be deducted from their next cash instalment, or that they've lost their scholarship for the semester. Facial recognition spots you smoking while pregnant (the system is tied to your medical records, and backdated, so works even if the smoker chooses to try and avoid the hospital or medical care)? Local social care finds out, comes to visit. Perhaps a teacher at your young son's school is informed. My, my, gossip *does* travel. Social ostracization follows. The system works. The state knows the car you're driving, so an unemployed 22-year old from a working class family (parental incomes are recorded, of course) in a BMW automatically flags as suspicious. His driving route is tracked, security camera snapshots taken, profiles created. All without human involvement. He gets arrested for being a dealer. Machine learning creates movement profiles of people likely to be drug dealers, gang members, prostitutes, violent anarchists and so on, selects them for enhanced surveillance. Things like gait analysis, movement speed and so on mean even those trying to escape the system can be caught. 

If this all sounds pretty authoritarian (and it is), think of the other side of the equation. One of the biggest problems in low-trust societies in Africa, South America, Eastern and Southern Europe and so on is that breaking the law pays. People who follow the rules, who pay their taxes, who don't bribe or accept bribery, who live a moral life, who care about the world around them, they're the suckers and the losers. Only belief in some kind of karma or external, religious punishment, or in the ultimate goodness of man can temper the tragedy of the commons. All are in decline. Social Credit can reward, in promotion, in taxation, in housing allowance, in student loans, perhaps even in political say, the quiet, law-abiding individual, the hard-worker, the person who doesn't cause trouble. It is in this way that a cohesive social fabric is restored. The average person is never going to bring themselves to care deeply about the five or ten million people with whom they share a city. But they can be made to care about the well-being of those people as an extension of their own status and value. This is the goal of the Chinese approach, and I think it admirable.

"I live out of a minivan to maximize what I can donate to charity. I’ve done so for over 3 years. I effectively donated 97% of my salary last year. 

I resolved to live minimally 8 years ago, and for the first year, I struggled. I spent a lot of attention arguing with myself about the permissibility of certain expenditures. I was like a vegetarian who missed meat a lot. But then, an epiphany flipped a switch inside my head, and after that moment, I became like an effortless vegetarian. 

I want to discuss the flipping of that switch and internal switch-flipping in general. In my head, I’ve been calling them internal paradigm shifts. I hope my own experiences will be useful, and I want to move forward on a paradigm shift I’ve been a little stuck on.

\-

In terms of pure content, the epiphany of seven years ago was not that interesting. I was thinking about how Native Americans felt when introduced to the concept of land ownership (I later learned that’s not what happened, but it doesn’t matter here). It must have been bizarre, I thought. Maybe it’d be similar to suggesting that somebody owns the air I breathe. 

I realized that lens of possessionlessness could be applied to everything. This laptop, it’s a laptop I happen to use often, and I take care of it. But what does it mean for it to be *mine*? Why does it *belong* to me? Can I really justify deserving exclusive use of it? Is that fair? Sure, I (well, my parents) work hard and receive money in exchange, but that’s driven by supply and demand, and supply and demand is not a moral law. It’s a descriptive law. It’s pretty much the law of the jungle, and that’s not a moral basis for anything.

I already believed that the world is super unfair. I decided the unfairness meant, in terms of ownership, that I don’t really own my stuff and that I instead only have power over it. Rather than the majority shareholder, I’m the CFO. I have since felt no temptation to use my money on myself.

I’ve built out and followed through on this internal paradigm extensively. E.g., I don’t miss middle-class luxuries, because I think of them in the same way that the middle class thinks of owning yachts. Sure, seems nice, but who feels pain about not owning a yacht? Also, I’m Christian, and this comes with a set of principles and heuristics about how to decide what I need (golden rule) and otherwise expand the paradigm.

\-

Internal paradigm shifting has been on my mind a lot since then. What happened in me? Why doesn’t the same thing happen to other people? How do I get them to live out of vans too? How can I shift paradigms in other aspects of my life? 

Here is some of my thinking:

* Internal paradigm shifts happen naturally, and sometimes predictably. Growing up, you realize that adults/parents are fallible, life isn’t fair, institutions are illusory, etc.
* They are discussed frequently. They are a category of advice (how to frame things, i.e. “think of it this way”). Religious leaders attempt to provoke them via sermons.
* They are viral, but infectiousness varies. It is higher when the details of the paradigm are concrete, e.g. when the components have specific functions and/or good concept handles. It also helps when they can be discussed often -- when they aren’t not embarrassing/taboo/awkward.
* They are spread best via close association with role models; consider high-performing teams and groups of hard-working friends. A role model provides proof that there is a sustainable internal ecosystem with unusual outcomes. Closer association provides higher resolution on expected outcomes of that ecosystem, improving the trial-and-error of iterative attempts at replicating it. 
* Incremental thinking prevents paradigm shifting. When people believe that the way forward is to essentially exercise a mental muscle, they become entrenched in that paradigm of personal growth. They can only envision a future where certain mental muscles have become stronger, and lose the imagination to envision a future where different muscles altogether are being used, or where no effort is required at all.
* Phrases like “x is actually y” are keyphrases for paradigm shifts. “Danger”, “risk”, and “opportunity” are also useful. For myself, this has worked well with learning.
   * I used to think I finished learning something when I felt I understood it and could discuss it fluently. But I noticed that with this set of criteria, I would often fail to propagate the new information to the rest of my worldview and practices/decisionmaking.
   * The sense of understanding, especially the feeling of receiving a profound insight, it actually inoculates me from completing the process of digesting new information. Hence, the sense of understanding is dangerous and should be treated with deep suspicion.

\-

I am curious to know your thoughts in general. I have some specific questions too:

* Do you see abstract discussion of internal paradigm shifts distinguished from mere understanding of concepts? People allude to instances of it often, but I can’t think of general discussion of how best to progress from conceptual understanding to internal paradigm shift.
* What patterns do you see when it comes to internal paradigm shifts?
* What strategies have been useful for your personal growth?
* What do you do when you know how your current paradigm leads to bad outcomes, but can’t think of a better alternative? What can you do to explore the space of available paradigms?",Internal paradigm shifts,arslqa,new,97,77,77,0

"Crime began falling in the early 90s and has pretty much continued to fall to the present day. We still have violent crime levels well above of what we had in the 1950s/early 60s, but it's a triumph to have eliminated so much violent crime.

As with any one-time societal-level event, it'll be a contentious issue to determine what factor led to this fall in violent crime (or even if there was one factor). Some have suggested that the national legalization of abortion, mass incarceration, or elimination of lead from gasoline were primarily responsible for the fall in the crime rate.

I'm curious what the current scholarship is regarding the lead hypothesis? The best write-up I've found is here: https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2018/02/an-updated-lead-crime-roundup-for-2018/. It makes a fairly compelling case, but I'm a little suspicious of potential bias — Mother Jones' editorial staff almost definitely wants the lead hypothesis, and not mass incarceration, to be the driving cause of crime reduction. In addition, much of the research is resting on one scholar, Rick Nevin, who's made a career of advocating for lead reduction. Obviously that's no reason to dismiss their arguments outright, but it does leave me a little wary. I have limited knowledge of statistics (and no ability to read/comprehend complex scientific/sociological research), so I don't think I'd be able to tell if they were p hacking. I reasonably trust this community to be well-informed and intellectually honest, so I thought I'd bring this issue here.

I think this is a really important question to resolve because of the growing societal consensus to end mass incarceration. If this lead research is shaky, it makes the incapacitation argument for crime reduction (i.e. lock up all the criminals for a long period of time) a bit stronger. If that's the case, criminal justice reform will have to be pursued particularly carefully to make sure we avoid returning to the crime rates of the 1980s/early 90s. Whereas, if lead poison was the thing that made the United States a more peaceful society, we should worry less about drastically reducing the amount of people we lock up.

"I know it's been joked about before about seeking dating advice from this community, but this is really more about wanting to hear others members' perspectives and experiences.

My thoughts are brewing around this question: Have you felt like your dating partner needed to have similar personality traits and quirks as yourself?  Ex: rational, high need for cognition, intellectually curious, probably into ""insight porn"", generally the type of person to be into reading long-form essays about interesting things, and probably enjoys writing long pieces of text as well (comments, essays, etc).  I also feel like a good subset of the population here tends to have a very high level of emotional self-awareness.

In this context, what sorts of people have you dated?  What do you think has worked out for you?  And what hasn't worked out?

Also, what patterns and bits of wisdom have you gained throughout your experiences?

I have always taken this to be a fairly universal desire (although many seem to compromise on it).  It's just hard to ""get you"" when the way you see the world is the result of over a decade of reading all sorts of nerdy things and mulling over them and writing about them.  I could be wrong thanks to my limited relationship experience, but I have taken that to be of equal importance to the usual getting-along-shit (ex: compatible ways of how you prefer to spend time, level of attachment, sense of humor, etc.).

We aimed to document the extent of misreporting, establish whether it was possible to publish correction letters on all misreported trials as they were published, and monitor responses from editors and trialists to understand why outcome misreporting persists despite public commitments to address it.


>*Methods*


>We identified five high-impact journals endorsing Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) (New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, British Medical Journal, and Annals of Internal Medicine) and assessed all trials over a six-week period to identify every correctly and incorrectly reported outcome, comparing published reports against published protocols or registry entries, using CONSORT as the gold standard. A correction letter describing all discrepancies was submitted to the journal for all misreported trials, and detailed coding sheets were shared publicly. The proportion of letters published and delay to publication were assessed over 12 months of follow-up. Correspondence received from journals and authors was documented and themes were extracted.

*Results*


>Sixty-seven trials were assessed in total. Outcome reporting was poor overall and there was wide variation between journals on pre-specified primary outcomes (mean 76% correctly reported, journal range 25–96%), secondary outcomes (mean 55%, range 31–72%), and number of undeclared additional outcomes per trial (mean 5.4, range 2.9–8.3). Fifty-eight trials had discrepancies requiring a correction letter (87%, journal range 67–100%). Twenty-three letters were published (40%) with extensive variation between journals (range 0–100%). Where letters were published, there were delays (median 99 days, range 0–257 days). Twenty-nine studies had a pre-trial protocol publicly available (43%, range 0–86%). Qualitative analysis demonstrated extensive misunderstandings among journal editors about correct outcome reporting and CONSORT. Some journals did not engage positively when provided correspondence that identified misreporting; we identified possible breaches of ethics and publishing guidelines.

>*Conclusions*


>All five journals were listed as endorsing CONSORT, but all exhibited extensive breaches of this guidance, and most rejected correction letters documenting shortcomings. Readers are likely to be misled by this discrepancy. We discuss the advantages of prospective methodology research sharing all data openly and pro-actively in real time as feedback on critiqued studies. This is the first empirical study of major academic journals’ willingness to publish a cohort of comparable and objective correction letters on misreported high-impact studies. Suggested improvements include changes to correspondence processes at journals, alternatives for indexed post-publication peer review, changes to CONSORT’s mechanisms for enforcement, and novel strategies for research on methods and reporting.

AI-assistant: By using the energy potential between two places with different temperatures.

"One of the under appreciated reasons for the modern popularity of Valentine's Day is it serves a coordination strategy to find philanderers and cheats. 

To start there's some fraction of men in the dating market who are cads. They're primarily interested in non-exclusive, casual sex. But the vast majority of women want at least some level of monogamous commitment in their relationships. The cads engage in deception to project a much higher level of exclusivity than they're actually committed to. 

The problem is cads are hard to detect. A signature behavior is that they're frequently found wooing multiple women concurrently, despite implicitly or explicitly proclaiming their undying affection to each one. Absent Orwellian surveillance, this type of behavior is nearly impossible to detect and prevent. ""Saturday night's for the wives, but Friday night's at the Copa with the girlfriends.""

The best countermeasure women have is to pick a rivalrous Schelling point. A single night that's universally understood to be pre-slotted for one's monogamous partner. Since a person can't be in two places at the same time, cads face a conundrum. 

Alice, Betty, Carla, and Debby all think they're Frank's girlfriend. But Frank can only pick one to spend Valentine's Day with. At the end of the night his fraud will be revealed to all but one of them.

What are the key takeaways? Spending Valentine's Day with someone is a very credible signal of exclusive romantic commitment. Even if you think the holiday is dumb or cheesy, even if your partner thinks the same thing, it's still important to give credence to it. The more widespread and longer-lived a Schelling point is, the more powerful it becomes. 

Second, if your partner is making excuses to not spend the day with you, you should update your Bayesian priors. Does it mean they're cheating on you for sure? Absolutely not. But if there's been other red flags, it's cause for concern. The most common excuse is *""I don't celebrate fake Hallmark holidays""*. But you also see things like a highly coincidental last minute emergency. 

The smoothest cheater pro-tip is to perennially book a trip over Feb 14 every year months in advance. Valentine's Day is always ragnarok for the philanderer.

Toby Ord, from the Future of Humanity Institute, is working on a major book on existential risk, to be published in early 2020. Like The Better Angels of our Nature or Animal Liberation, it aims to be rigorous and advance the field, yet still be readable by the educated public. Key audiences will be the existential risk community, policy makers, opinion shapers, effective altruists, and young people deciding what to do with their lives. The book will show how great humanity’s potential is, then explain the risks that threaten it and why safeguarding humanity is a central moral issue of our time. In doing so, it takes care to frame the idea of reducing existential risk so that it appears natural rather than contrarian; sensible rather than silly; and mature rather than juvenile.

"I am an English professor at a small liberal arts university in the Midwest. I teach a composition course, and each semester ~~I make my students~~ my students are privileged to read a book that they then need to incorporate into a term paper. For years I’ve been assigning *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, but I switched it up this year with Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson’s *[The Elephant in the Brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28820444-the-elephant-in-the-brain).*

For those of you not familiar with [Hanson](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3sjtar/a_robin_hanson_primer/) or [Simler](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/author/kevinsimler/), the book covers signaling theory, status games, self-deception, and coalition building as pivotal and underappreciated aspects of our social lives. We also discussed the [barber pole theory](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/22/right-is-the-new-left/) of fashion.

For one class, I presented my students with several scenarios and asked them to put on their *Elephant in the Brain* hats—how would Simler/Hanson answer these questions? I thought I’d share some of them with you all as well. 

------------------------------------------


1\. Musician Post Malone is famous for [his look](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8203589/mediaviewer/rm451704832): six prominent face tattoos. He acquired these tattoos *after* he became famous—why?

2\. Speaking of face tattoos, why would a White prisoner in jail get a prominent face tattoo with a white nationalist gang sign like a swastika, even knowing that this carries a heavy social price once they leave prison?

3\.  An obscure band has a break-out hit with their sixth album. Suddenly, they are famous and recognized around the world. Many long-time fans HATE that their band is now famous. Why?



4\. Harvard has an endowment of an astonishing [$39 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/harvard-endowment-gains.html). So why do alumni keep giving money to it?



5\. People will stand in hours to see the Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris. However, you can see excellent reproductions online. Why spend the time and effort, then?



6\. Check out this quiz https://www.proforhobo.com/  Why would prestigious professors not care if they look like hobos?


7\. To become a barber in California, it requires an astonishing [1500 hours](https://www.barbercosmo.ca.gov/forms_pubs/publications/faqs.shtml) of school—1600 for cosmetology. Why is this requirement set so high?


8\. Why are *anonymous* donations so rare – only 1% of all donations?


9\. Why do people who buy expensive, environmentally friendly products and feel they must tell their friends and family about it? Why do people doing Crossfit feel they must tell you about it?


10\. On social media like Twitter, strong, uncompromising opinions get “retweeted” and broadcasted far and wide. On the other hand, uncertain, heavily caveated opinions with nuance are relatively ignored. Why would this be the case, according to Simler/Hanson?

The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives. It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and if you should feel free to post content which could go here in it's own thread. You could post:

- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

"Say you have an idea, stumble across an interesting link, someone sends you a book recommendation, or you otherwise gather some snippet of information that you'd like to make a note of for future reference. What kind of organizational setups do you have in place to handle these things?

Personally, I feel like my current setup for handling this kind of storage is pretty mediocre. I have several lists across a few note-taking apps, some LaTeX documents I update periodically, a Google Sheets page I keep track of some things in, and an [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jot-notes-todos/id1329220696) for quick storage of idle thoughts on my phone, but things aren't very well consolidated and I wish more of the things I encounter had an easy place in which to make a note of so that I could search them up at a later date. 

In particular, the three primary desiderata I have for a note-taking app or process are:

* Ease of entry: I want to go from the thought or link or comment to having it written down somewhere with as few clicks as possible. The ideal application has programmable keyboard shortcuts to start entering a new note into any one of a list, document, or folder. Web clipping is nice but not really essential for me. 

* Categorization: My ideal is something like Mnemosyne's tag system, with hierarchically nested tags that can be combined in any order and which any subset of can be viewed at a given time (in fact, Mnemosyne's is so good I've seriously considered using the application as a note-taking application on its own and ignoring the spaced repetition functionality entirely). But I'd be satisfied with merely one which lets you easily enter in lots of tags and search for them later, Tumblr-style. (But I would like this tagging for small things, not entire documents, which is why I dislike Evernote and favor Dynalist.)

* Access: I'd like to be able to find stuff and export it in some computer-parseable format pretty easily, when possible; the dream would be something with an intuitive Python API to access my documents, but that's a long ways from what I'd be happy with. (The sorts of things I'd like to do include like ""I wonder how many SSC posts I've read? I'll export all the data from my note containing a list of things I've read and count the number of distinct URLs at slatestarcodex.com."")

At the moment my plan is to try and migrate almost everything to [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/), but I'm not tremendously happy with that (the process costs me a few seconds more to go from ""I should make a note of this"" to said note existing than I'd like, and I'm not sure how I feel about their tag system at the moment.)",What's your process for storing things you want to refer to later?,apvnkh,new,47,56,56,0
"I recently came across a blog post about the word ""salitter"", which is found in Cormac McCarthy's novel ""The Road"". I really enjoyed reading it and just wanted to share:  


 ""***Salitter***, as used by Boehme, as used by McCarthy, is the *essence of God*. It is the *essence of God* which is “drying from the earth” in this apocalyptic novel. It is the end of the Earth for humanity, and also the abandonment of the Earth by what had been divine.

 As humans seeking to know, then understand, then communicate, we are all bound by the language we know. Our language is our *always-personal* set of metaphors which we grasp at, and sometimes are successful in doing so, in order to describe whatever-it-is that we are perceiving that we need to share. Often, we feel frustrated in being able to convey the depths of meaning, or wonder, or urgency about a particular subject because we don’t have the words we want in the repertoire  of words we know. We feel sometimes like the painter who wants to paint a wildflower field, but has only her fingertips and must *smear* a wildflower field instead. Some things demand a precision in description beyond the impressionistic display of colors.""

&#x200B;

As someone who considers himself basically an agnostic/atheist, I still find ""religious"" words and metaphors to often be powerful, beautiful, and full of meaning. Perhaps there is something in all of us that yearns for transcendence...

I was/am one of the 4% of SSC-ers who have/suspect they have some type of eating disorder (according to the [most recent survey](https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/2019%20SSC%20Survey.html)).

The post and the comment thread sent me down a rabbit hole of research. With help from an SSC commenter, I've started a recovery project. I've written up what I've learned as ""The no-nonsense guide for people who think they might have an eating disorder."" It's at this URL:

[https://sites.google.com/view/the-no-nonsense-guide/guide](https://sites.google.com/view/the-no-nonsense-guide/guide)

---

Here's the TL;DR:

* The standard view of anorexia/eating disorder as an extreme ""desire to be thin"" is incorrect.
* Experiments show that both the mental and and physical eating disorder symptoms can be induced in the laboratory (and in animals).
* Probably some subset of the population is vulnerable to developing eating disorders if they wind up with too little bodyfat.
* Psychological symptoms can be relieved by eating more, exercising less, and gaining bodyfat.
* Co-morbid depression, anxiety, and OCD don't get magically cured by weight restoration (but they probably will get somewhat better).

My goal was to write for somebody who was in the position I was a few months ago. Any eating disorder recovery material I saw before I dismissed, because I didn't think it applied to me (I'm an adult man; I'm not dangerously underweight; I don't have a history of trauma or abuse; etc).

With the eviction of the culture thread, this article seems especially apropos. It is interesting to see the evolution of Scott's position on truthful and kind tolerance. The rest of the content of the article is very good too, 2014-2015 Scott had so many classics. 

The parts that stood out:

>In my final discussion with Arthur, way down in the comment section of my response post, we discussed our different definitions of tolerance and in-groupishness. I said we should tolerate people who are truthful and kind, regardless of their political opinions. Arthur thought, on the contrary, we should tolerate people with the correct political opinions, regardless of whether they are truthful and kind. 

In the comments Scott also added:

>Nyan Sandwich recently brought up an important distinction between intellectual-analysis-groups and movements.
>Insofar as you are an intellectual-analysis-group, engage with everyone, cherish those who disagree with you as people you can learn from, and have an extremely open mind.
>Insofar as you are a movement, stick to your message, crush dissent mercilessly, and discourage fraternization with the enemy.
>I’m not sure I agree with this distinction, but it’s an interesting one to think about, especially if you see people doing the other one and you think they’re doing yours wrong.

Optimistically, maybe no longer spending weird points on tolerating the full spectrum of truthful and kind opinions signals that the slatestarcodex crowd is now transitioning from an intellectual analysis group into a movement for influence?

"I have a psychiatrist who, so far, does whatever I want. I'm a pretty educated consumer, so this generally works out well, but it means that I try to go into appointments with a well-researched plan for what I think we should do, because he has never yet told me no, and if I ask him for advice he usually says it's up to me. I've never asked him for anything addictive/with any street value, and he might say no to that. 

Current situation: I've been taking bupropion for a long time. Last year, during a bad depressive episode, I raised the dose from 300 to 450. It helped a lot, but it also completely killed my appetite. Six months later, my mood was mostly ok and I was below 17 BMI and I bruised my tailbone sitting in a chair, so we took it back down to 300. 

That was a few weeks ago. I can eat again, which is great, and means I can also exercise again without feeling like I'm going to vomit or faint. However, my mood is worse. It is completely tolerable and not causing much functional impairment, but the prospect of feeling like this forever still sounds pretty miserable and I am having nonspecific suicidal thoughts (no plans, no danger to self or others). 

I previously tried Lexapro and it helped a little but not that much, and also gave me sexual side effects even combined with the Wellbutrin. My thyroid is fine, I'm not anemic, I eat a lot of grains and pulses and occasional meat and also ice cream. 

Thoughts? As I see it, options are:

* Stick with 300 Wellbutrin for a while, focus on exercise and sleep and eating and see if I can make that work. 

* Go back to 450 Wellbutrin. I don't think this is a good idea unless my mood is much worse, because I'm trying not to starve.

* Add an SSRI. Not excited about this because of the sex part, but would try it again. 

* Add something else? Luckily right now it's just as well if it makes me gain weight, so would consider something like Remeron maybe.

"I'm currently taking an intensive course, and as my priories are never in order, I've spent much of time thinking about the optimal method of note-taking. I'm  fascinated by this question because the majority of students (and people) use woefully inefficient studying techniques. Studying is in many ways a time-sensitive activity, and wasted time means less content studied and less knowledge retained. With something so important, something that involves a mandatory 12 years of your life through primary school, it's strange to think that little of education is oriented toward optimizing it. After some thought I've concluded that a modified version of the Cornell Method (hereafter referred to as PenPractice's Cornell) is the superior note-taking system for the vast majority of people in the vast majority of cases. I think this is a reasonable conclusion to come to when a sufficient level of complexity is considered. In fact, I think it even defeats Anki and other SRS programs (though not in every case). What follows are my thoughts.

**Problemata**
-----------

Let's consider *Sentential* note-taking the first step in the default studying system. Your teacher explains the concepts you will be learning, implores the class to take notes, and you dutifully transcribe the information being presented. What's on the board goes into your notebook, hopefully with a title above, and maybe even with some ""key terms"" on the side for further organization. Class ends, you do your homework, and the cycle continues. Occasionally you read through your notes -- perhaps there's an answer to a homework question you need to find in your books. A test appears on the horizon and you realize you need to get down to business. You begin the second step: you go through your notes and make flashcards, diagrams, outlines, and maybe even look through old homework questions. You take the test and, depending on how much time you had to make flashcards and look through old homework problems, you pass. What's so inefficient about *that*? 

We're going to use this problemata to explain all the ways studying can be made more efficient with PenPractice's new Cornell Method. 

**Inefficiency in classroom note-taking**

Each time you took notes in class you could have created a ""flashcard"" system *within your notebook*, at the *same exact time* you were taking notes, *without any extraneous effort*. This is accomplished through a (modified) version of the Cornell System: one-third from the left of your page you draw a straight thin line with a pencil from top to bottom. The left is thus 1/3rd the page and the right is 2/3rds the page. The line is thin enough that you can see it if you want to, and thin enough that you can ignore it if you want to. On the left side goes the TERM you are learning (often called a cue), and on the right goes the DEFINITION of the term (often called a response). It looks [like this](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*TU8qeIqHMoxc9JAT.jpg), with a thinner line and without the two horizontal lines. The Cue -> Response works with all material learned, from simple definitions, to rigorous questions (put in term category), to insights you need to remember. The Cue -> Response is thus a series of flashcards within your notes that is accessible on a per-topic basis without extraneous time added, and linear in terms of lecture material. When you want to study, just hide the Response with a piece of paper (I use cardboard), and go down the columns. The thinness of the line allows Titles, Summaries, and diagrams to ignore the format, while quickly allowing you to resume taking flashnotes when desired. The PenPractice's Cornell Method becomes much more efficient than simple flashcards, however.

**Inefficiency in flashcard learning**

With flashcards you start with a large pile, and gradually the pile shrinks and orders itself according to what you do and do not know. This isn't a bad system compared to simple sentential studying, but it has notable drawbacks. (1) As the pile grows larger the context of each cards becomes obfuscated, and any error in specificity when taking notes requires the student to retrieve his notebook and find the place associated with the flashcard. (2) When confronted with a tricky card we can't seem to grasp, the student often keeps quizzing himself, when what he should do is take to his notebook to rewrite the concept. (3) Though a small drawback, the pile of notecards introduces a new format apart from the notebook, meaning every time you want to diagram or make sense of or rewrite or outline, you need to task-shift back to your notebook -- and all task-shifts come with a cognitive tax. 

The superiority of new Cornell System is clear for (2) and (3), but (1) requires explanation. When you take your notebook and study your cues, every time you get one wrong you dot it with a red pen (or, if you want, a normal pen). This is the ""difficult"" pile of flashcards, but more precise, as the cues with the most red dots are the cues that you need to be studying pronto. Because studying is always time-sensitive, you start with the 5 dots and work your way down to the 1 dots, and if you have extra time, you go ahead and study the ones you've never gotten wrong. This is a built-in time management system that ensures you are always directing your studying at what most needs studying. This is a bit tedious to implement with flashcards. The most difficult cues can always be rewritten into a new section of your notebook as well, along with outlines and diagrams, with the added benefit of being written by you (something that has shown to be more effective than merely recalling or hearing).

Additionally, you have all of your flashnotes with you whenever you're in class. If you're 10 minutes early that's a quick study session on *exactly* what you ought to be learning (red dotted down).

**Inefficiency in exam preparation and homework problem studying**

Homework problems can either be studied using the red-dot submethod of the Cornell System or incorporated into your notebook, depending on whether it is turned in or complementary. Merely doing all the problems again without regard for the difficult ones is inefficient. Your notebook at this point is essentially one large exam, and the best possible way to practice would be to sit down and test yourself on the questions (cues) for the same amount of time as the actual test, without looking at the answers. Did you do well? No? Well, that's how you'll do on the test. 

**The Anki Question**
------

I wouldn't be surprised if more than half of the readers of SSC have heard of Anki. It's huge in the productivity / efficiency world. Anki is a flashcard program that comes equipped with built-in spaced repetition: tell the program if you got it Totally Correct, ""Phew"" Correct, or ""Fuck"", and it'll schedule the cards at the time that is most optimal for you to learn. The cards you already know will seldom be studied, the cards you are confused by more often, and the cards that hurt your soul will appear super frequently. And this is only scratching the surface of anki: you can add images and sound, you can add ""tags"" and subclasses, you can do all of this! In theory, Anki should kick Cornell's ass -- we type faster than we write, it schedules what you study better than you can, it has a mobile app, it has rigorous organizational features, and you can even type in a sentence and program it to omit one of a number of selected words so that you can make 10 flashcards after only writing one card! It's perfect! Or is it? The problem with Anki is that humans have a few idiosyncricies that actually wind up overriding the benefits of Anki (in most cases). 

(1) **We are given to distraction**. Computers are distraction devices. If you're Cal Newport, maybe you can use Anki. But for most people, studying on the same device you use to make memes and watch hardcore parkour compilations is ripe for disaster. With a notebook you can escape to the library and have no distraction; with a computer, it's constantly at your fingertips, waiting to be typed into the URL bar faster than you can think. 

(2) **We remember far more when we write than when we type**. I'm not sure why this is, but it's been replicated in a number of studies. Maybe it's school conditioning, maybe it's speed, or maybe writing is more likely to lead to a ""flow"" state (see Cziksentmihalyi) because it's slightly more complicated than typing. Writing out your ""cards"" is superior to typing your cards because by the time you've written it you've probably retained a fair bit of information, yet if you typed it quickly it might have already escaped retention. 

(3) If you're having trouble understanding something you have to task shift away from Anki and into an (empty) notebook, or a MindMapping program, or a text document. **Every task shift comes with a cognitive tax**, even something as simple as taking out a notebook. It's best to have as few task-shifts as possible when studying. If you're learning from a textbook, your cues are on one side and your answers *and* explanations, contexts, and diagrams can be on the other. Anki simply does not allow for this.

(4) There's no hierarchical or organization structure in Anki. Your notebook, however, can be both outlines *and* flashcards, all ordered by topic, and you can always flip to an adjacent page when confused about context.

(5) Reading a textbook and inputting something into Anki at the same time is depressing. Try it. You'll never do it again. Bonus if you do it on a round table like the ones at Starbucks. ",Modified Cornell Method: the optimal note-taking and studying system,ap437v,new,47,64,64,0

"By 'rationalist community' I mean everyone mentioned in Scott's [wonderful map](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/images/9/91/Ramap.jpg).

Like pretty much everyone here, I grew up in the [Bay Area memespace](https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1538439586/otherposts/Bay-Area-memespace1.jpg). I discovered LessWrong _before_ Reddit so my mind's been stained with the Rationalist Kool-Aid for as long as my Internet memory serves. 

I…suppose I'm not alone when I say I've always felt rather lonely. I hope you don't take this as yet another _hurr-durr ingroup signal_ because it's not. It's honestly not. But I felt like I had vastly more in common with people on the other side of the world than with the people I grew up with, and for the longest time I've always felt like I had to hide this huge, fundamental part of my self from everyone lest I be shunned and/or quartered in the ultra-religious country I was born in.

**Q: If you've been part of the community for so long, why didn't you talk to anyone?**

…I wasn't confident enough in my reasoning skills back then. Sure, I clicked on Bayesianism really early, as well as anti-deathism, and Friendly AI, but it was just me, a lonesome pimply 13-year-old kid barely keeping up with math PhDs and über-prodigies who learned Rust when they were 18 months old.

Plus, there's also the fact that I deliberately capped myself to read only 25-30% of the Sequences. I took [That Alien Message](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5wMcKNAwB6X4mp9og/that-alien-message) a bit too seriously looking back and so I honestly thought if I withheld some of the data from myself and tried reconstructing those parts of rationality, I would be able to [go beyond](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aFEsqd6ofwnkNqaXo/go-forth-and-create-the-art) if you will. And for the most part, I think that's worked out well for me^1.



**Q: How come you're so obsessed with being part of the IRL community? We live perfectly good lives being part of the formless matrix, form perfectly sane friendships.**

When I entered uni, I had no social skills whatsoever. In my country, English is a language of _*delicatessen*_, of fine dining and social climbing and signaling you're part of the 1% who can buy the entire school if they reprimand you for something. Because I was raised on the Internet, I spoke straight English, and this along with not knowing how to position my arms non-awkwardly meant I got left out of a lot of groups.

So, I spend the better half of my sophomore year staring at a bottle of Drano and fantasising how great it would be to just take a sip^2.

Eventually, I used what I learned of the Art to reason myself out of my pit of despair and made over 200+ friends in the next couple of years. However, even after all the 14-hour long talks (my area of specialty), I can definitely say that there's just something…missing—don't get me wrong! I have met many people who are waaay smarter than me, who have me conclusively beat in both depth and variety of knowledge and understanding, who are better at moving mounds of dirt according to their utility functions, who are so naturally good at leadership they can temporarily suspend the Culture War in a big room, all of whom did not require x-rationality to become that awesome. But something's to be said about climbing up the [pyramid of argumentative experience](https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/argument_hierarchy.png) with people you _know in your heart_ to be genuinely interested in the truth. Y'know, people you can trust would never intentionally trap you in argumentative landmines.

To solve that, I formed a tiny reading club in my city called ROT13^-1 (**Engcnpx**)^4. I scoured the internet for LessWrong/OB/SSC readers who live in the Philippines and handpicked them from the chaff. Apart from me, only one of them is a long-time rationalist so we kind of have to go over a few things every now and then. But nonetheless, the experience has been great so far! For the first time in my life, I can tell them what I really think without having to bridge really wide inferential gaps or offending anyone unintentionally. 



I am reminded of [how Luke describes his experience in Berkeley](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Q5CjE8pRiACqTvhRM/the-good-news-of-situationist-psychology#Improving_rationality) a couple of years ago:

> It's fascinating to take part in a conversation with *really* trained rationalists. It might go something like this:

> > Person Three: ""Hmmm. Well, I have a lot of confusion and uncertainty about that.""
>
> This kind of thing can go on for hours, and not just on abstract  subjects like simulation arguments, but also on more personal issues  like fears and dreams and dating.

It's kind of like that, but only half an hour at a time.

**Q: Why now? Why not tomorrow? Next year? When the sun's burnt out and we've all been turned into paperclips?**

I [won a certain online contest](https://pioneer.app/) back in October and as a result, I'm gonna be flying to Berkeley in March or April. I would very much like to see what *the* IRL Community is all about, and perhaps put faces to the voices I've been hearing in my head for almost a decade now^5.


So! I'm a lurker finally coming out of the woodwork^6. Where do I go and who do I talk to?

"This is a topic that I'm heavily interested in, because of certain family circumstances, but can't seem to find much study.

I've read that boys of single parent mothers tend to have worse overall outcomes socioeconomically. They tend to be more violent, and are much more highly represented in US prisons than boys of two parents.

I've also read that girls of single parent fathers tend to end up more promiscuous, and have a higher rate of teen pregnancy. I read that on some fact sheet summary someplace, and haven't found the study to back it up. There's almost no study about male single parenting anywhere. Now granted, 92% of single parents are women, but you'd think the remaining 8%, which still constitutes about 2 million households in the US, would have had some study.

I can't find anything anywhere that compares the two sets of circumstances with each other in an objective manner. And I also can't find anything where heredity is taken into account. So that leads me to a lot of very weird questions, for which SSC is probably the only safe place to ask without getting dogpiled by an ideology mob. Here's two.

Question 1: 

Is it possible that boys raised by single mothers have problems with violence because they inherited a genetic disposition to violent and/or irresponsible behavior from their (now absent) fathers, and that violent and/or irresponsible behavior of their fathers was what caused them to leave the family in the first place? 

This theory would run counter to the Red Tribe MGTOW Jordan Peterson narrative that mothers are bad at raising boys, but would *also* run counter to the Blue Tribe tabula rasa blank slate narrative that behavior is a product of ""society"" and not genes. 

Question 2:

Is it possible that the lack of attention to single dads, and lack of comparisons between single dads and single moms, is because single dads *do better*? As much as the Blue Tribe media is trashing men right now, you'd think if there were any evidence that single dads do worse than single moms on aggregate, they'd be flaunting that. This makes me wonder if the lack of study on this topic isn't due to tribal narrative bias.

I have been thinking about the long-term psychological impact of childhood trauma and am hoping that the SSC community can provide relevant research and insights. 

In the Nature/Nurture debate, I am decidedly on the Nature side with a strong interest in genetics and HBD.  I take as a given that just as geneticists are finding genes correlated to developing cancer or height, they will also find genes that cause a greater likelihood for depression, anxiety, anger, etc.

I also accept the argument that a case where a father gets angry and beats his son who subsequently grows up and tends to gets angry and hit his own child can be significantly explained by the son sharing roughly 50% of his genes with his father, including those causing a propensity towards anger and violence. 

Or that the severe anxiety of a woman raised by a highly anxious mother is likely largely genetic in origin.

That being said, what are the real ramifications of severe childhood trauma? Is there any strong evidence for lifetime psychological or emotional consequences of trauma that would not have manifested without said trauma?

And I understand the near impossibility (under current laws) of running large-scale randomized human trials where half the participants are traumatized and half are not. But presumably you could run randomized controlled studies with mice or monkeys. 

Even granting phenotype vs. genotype, where a person with a genetic propensity towards anxiety is raised in a completely worry-free, calm, blissful, household and has only positive and relaxed experiences throughout their entire education is less likely to ever manifest anxiety. 

However, that person, even without traumatic levels of suffering, exposed to ‘normal’ levels of stress in their youth, are still likely to develop anxiety.

Perhaps the severity of their anxiety is proportional to the levels of anxiety experienced during their formative years. But that’s speculative. 

So is there any solid evidence for the real long-term impact of childhood trauma? ",Evidence for and against long-term psychological and emotional effects of Childhood Trauma,aohr4t,new,11,10,10,0

"I hope this post doesn't veer too far into the CW. My intention is to explore a historical question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here is an argument I've heard twice in the past few weeks:

In its distant past, India had a relatively sexually progressive culture. Homosexuality and promiscuity were generally tolerated, especially among the lowest and highest castes. It produced the Kama Sutra, which is probably the most famous sex guide in history. Even transgender people were accepted and had a special reverence within Hindu tradition.

Today, India is a notoriously sexist and homophobic country. Tackling the national epidemic of sexual harassment and rape has been a major goal of the government upper class for over a decade, with many of the major city's subways creating ""women's only"" cars, and many companies/universities giving preferential treatment to women. Incidents like the [2012 bus gang rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Delhi_gang_rape), in which six strangers on a bus (including the driver) decided to torture and gang rape a woman to death seemingly on a whim, have remained a stain on the country. Meanwhile, homosexuality only became *decriminalized* last September, and IIRC, is still illegal to portray in the media.

Question -How did India go from quite tolerant by past standard to extremely intolerant by modern standards?

Answer - The British Empire shifted its culture.

Between 1612 and 1947, the British controlled some portion of India. Based on the uniquely homophobic and prudish doctrines within Judeo-Christianity, Britain's culture followed suit, and developed laws to enforce their moral norms. Homosexuality was officially illegal, and common law harshly punished adulterers and philanderers.

Both the moral norms of the colonizers and their laws converted India's culture to Victorian prudishness. Eventually Britain and the rest of the West modernized to liberal sexual norms, but India has yet to catch up.

&#x200B;

My knowledge on India and historical sexual norms are close to non-existent. So I'm asking everyone here - is this argument plausible?

My knee-jerk reaction is that I find it difficult to believe that of all the possible cultural alterations that could have occurred under colonialism, this relatively narrow domain had such a massive shift. Despite the efforts of missionaries over hundreds of years, only 2.3% of Indians are Christian. Yes, Indians drive on the ~~right~~ left side of the road and use British-style trains, but the ongoing influence of British culture is fairly limited outside of government, infrastructure, and language.

But I don't know. I don't have enough knowledge to make a confident assessment.",Did Britain make India homophobic?,ao4yja,new,21,6,6,0
"Does anyone know of a place that collects pieces of knowledge/wisdom that are floating out there in the culture that have turned out to be false? I come across these all the time, whether it's a an old scientific study (I don't think new scientific studies can count as 'common knowledge') or a piece of folk wisdom, or a historical false fact. Even things as simple as mis-atributed quotes.

"Some recent research suggests that at least in the natural sciences it is extremely helpful to do a doctorate and a postdoc such that the early career researcher has expertise (from their doctorate) that their boss (the principal investigator) doesn’t have. This enables them to fruitfully link the technical skills and ways of thinking that are different between their doctoral supervisor and their PI.

We also have reason to believe that treatments exist that make researchers more likely to write good grant applications and get faculty appointments at universities as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute does it. One hopes that they are also more research productive but if a one year predicted gets better researchers one would hope it would be expanded somewhere, somehow.

> [Our study found that awardees of the HHMI Cloister Program are significantly more likely than nonawardees to pursue research careers, as reflected in their higher rates of receipt of NIH postdoctoral awards and faculty appointments with research responsibility. Awardees of the HHMI Medical Fellows Program are also more likely than nonawardees to receive NIH postdoctoral awards, and are somewhat more likely to receive faculty appointments with responsibility.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.552.8038&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

Predoctoral fellowships are not just a medicine thing either. The Global Priorities Institute has [several](https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/vacancy-predoctoral-research-fellow-in-economics/) for those considering grad school in economics.

All this reminds me of [Ph.D. by Publication](https://theconversation.com/a-phd-by-publication-or-how-i-got-my-doctorate-and-kept-my-sanity-11012) where you publish three to five academic articles and defend them and then get a doctorate on the basis that you have made several original contributions to the scholarly literature already.

Is there some special reason the research apprenticeship, the important part of a Ph.D. after the coursework is done can’t be broken up further than it is already? Instead of the current system do the equivalent of four or five one year predocs where you work as a research assistant and eventually coauthor with multiple academics?

Or are there other, better ways of doing research and training for research?

"I'm very interested in how the members of this sub would approach a problem I've been assigned at work. 

The situation is that my city (in Australia) has a few youth groups (15-20 year old males) who have been incredibly prolific offenders since about 2016. In that time they've mostly conducted car thefts, burglaries, armed robberies and that kind of thing. Lately there have been marked changes in behaviour. They've actively decided to maintain a low profile. This has resulted in a massive decrease in high visibility offending, moving into weird paypal scams, CC scams, confidence scams, that kind of thing. Concurrently, the main groups have been getting into massive brawls and seem to also be migrating into drug trafficking. The reason is basically because local cops could spot these kids from a mile away, even on grainy, shitty CCTV. They just aren't getting away with serious crimes anymore. 

My task is to determine whether this group may begin to acquire firearms. I have a few different approaches, but I'm at a brick wall regarding a baseline/outside view. I have a lot of inside view data I can draw upon, but in terms of coming up with an initial working likelihood, I'm lost. 

My best guess is that i should just take the number of group members who have been charged with firearm offences in the past (4%) and work up or down from there using my inside views of these particar groups. Is that logic sound? It isn't a real outside view, but there's no comparative youth groups that I can measure off. 

I have basically unlimited crime data.

The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives. It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and if you should feel free to post content which could go here in it's own thread. You could post:

- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

"I have only a superficial knowledge of these events, but there are other explanations than the ones Scott gave in his review of Zero to One:

Did Thiel finance lawsuits against Gawker with a calculated expectation that he would bankrupt them, or with a calculated expectation that he would become bored long before it had cost him an appreciable portion of his fortune?

Did Thiel endorse Trump with a calculated expectation that Trump would win and reward Thiel for the endorsement, or just because he liked Trump? Thiel's political views aren't Trumpian but they're also outside the conservative mainstream, Thiel's business interests are relatively insensitive to tariffs and sensitive *to* regulations, and pretty much any president would buy his Orwellware, so he doesn't really need to endorse someone.

Alternatively, Thiel may just like keeping the door open for low probability, high yield turns of events; he's one of the Bay Area mega-rich with plans to flee to New Zealand in the event of societal collapse, after all.

"Evaluating the merits of Montessori education, especially for early-childhood development, has become personally relevant. So I'm throwing it out to the r/SSC hivemind...**Montessori pre-school, yay or nay?** Anecdotes from teachers or former students, studies, links to research or blogs ... all are welcome.

I can see a couple different possibilities:

1. It is a superior pedagogical system and you should definitely choose it.
2. It has some advantages, but some disadvantages as well.
3. It has some benefits, but the same benefits can be achieved via much simpler means.
4. This is just a social-class filter, you're paying to have your kid hang out with other kids whose parents care about education and can afford this.
5. All of this has no long-term benefits, it's just glorified day-care with a layer of pretend-school to make the parents feel better.
6. This weird wood-block cult actually hurts your kid, don't do it.

I gotta say, from the outside, it looks pretty impressive. I don't care much for the propaganda videos online, who knows how much of that is staged. But I was able to personally witness a class, and in the five minutes I was there, I saw two different kids put their activity toys back in their trays/boxes, and put the tray/box back on the shelf, completely on their own without prompting, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. They do seem to do a good job teaching executive function, self-control, and socialization in mixed-age groups.

"A thought occurred to me today on the Brussels metro: *why are public transit fares so high?*

Consider a car. A car costs about $15000, maybe 20K, to manufacture, and can run for about 200,000 miles, seating up to five (but let's say four) people. If a gallon of gas is three dollars and it gets 30 MPG, then running the car costs twenty cents per mile--ten for gas and ten for the sticker cost of the car spread out over its lifetime. Add in four to five cents a mile for maintenance, which seems about correct, and at 24 cents a mile for four passengers the cost of a trip is six cents per passenger per mile. The majority of trips across a normally-sized downtown in a car, excluding any cost of employing a driver, will come down to well under fifty cents a passenger, possibly even under a quarter, if the car is fully occupied.

Now compare a bus or a tram. (Metros require tunnels, which are extraordinarily expensive, but the infrastructure for streetcars and busses is much cheaper). They are bigger, of course, so they will cost more than a car--but they shouldn't cost *that* much more per passenger because the cost of the tram/bus should scale with the surface area of the vehicle while the number of possible passengers should scale with the volume, which increases much more quickly than the surface area. We could expect operating cost per mile per passenger to be a little bit higher for trams and buses than for cars, but not significantly more--certainly not a whole order of magnitude more.

Compare this, though, to actual fares. Off the top of my head: $2.75 a trip in New York City; €2.10 in Brussels; 60 rubles (about a dollar) in St. Petersburg; two yuan (around thirty cents) for a bus trip in Chengdu and anywhere from thirty cents to around $1.10-1.20 for a metro trip depending on distance; twenty cents in Ulaanbaatar. Again, as I said, metros are unusual because they require tunnels, which don't come cheap. But it looks like Chinese, Russians and Mongolians are paying much nearer to the operating cost of a mass transit trip, while Americans and western Europeans are paying up to an order of magnitude more money than they ""ought"" to be paying.

(and of course even then American and European transit systems require millions of dollars of tax money a year to make ends meet; they can't rely on fares alone)

This looks like cost disease of some ilk. In particular, until we have really good driverless vehicles mass transit needs to have drivers, and those drivers are usually part of public-sector unions and can demand very high concessions from the public purse. In China and Russia labor costs are lower, so transit fares are much cheaper. But if this is true, then the vast majority of public transit money in the US and western Europe should be going to driver salaries and benefits--and if not, where *is* it going?",Why is public transit so expensive?,ancimj,new,119,43,43,0

"If I ever wake up in a new world and find that my years here on earth were actually a simulation or a highly immersive videogame, I'm almost certainly convinced that dreams will turn out to have been a massive Easter Egg hidden in plain sight. Every night when we sleep, many of us undergo complex unpredictable conscious experiences, often involving narrative elements. And while [we have some theories about the neurological function of different sleep stages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEbyITI13zg), to the best of my knowledge, the phenomenon of dreaming is still largely mysterious.

I take it the pop-science explanation of dreaming goes something like this: while we sleep, our brains engage in a bunch of information-pruning and consolidation processes. In the course of this processing, various representations get activated and come into conscious awareness. But that fails to explain some of the most striking features of dreaming. For example...

* Why should any of the processing just discussed activate states of consciousness? We know that a huge variety of different cognitive tasks can be accomplished wholly unconsciously, including [learning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612179/?otool=igbcambulib), [emotions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763415301901), and [retention of information in memory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211010888). Insofar as it's possible to link consciousness to any specific kinds of mental activity, it seems to be associated with cognitively demanding processes and/or those involving multi-step reasoning; in other words, stuff that doesn't seem to happen much during sleep.
* If dreaming does serve an important cognitive function, why is there such massive variation in people's reported dream experiences? Some people (doubtless including some of you reading this) [report dreaming extremely rarely](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/dream-catcher/201204/people-who-do-not-dream). There are also significant differences in frequency of dream reports [among men and women and across different ages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3389337/). [And why did sleep researchers until the 1950s assume that dreams normally occurred in black and white](http://www.faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzPapers/DreamB&W.pdf)?
* Finally - and most perplexingly for me - why do dreams often seem to have complex narrative structures, with emotional or symbolic subtexts reflective of individuals' day-to-day concerns? If I knew nothing about dreaming, and was merely given the pop-sci version described above, I'd assume that dreaming was a matter of transient unrelated impressions: random smells, colours, ideas, emotions. But while some dreams may be like this, many aren't. Many people have dreams that track their day-to-day fears and desires (e.g., missing flights, showing up to class unprepared, etc.). People have recurring dreams. And some people (myself included) have dreams that feature their own recurring cast of unreal characters and locations. All of this seems to go way beyond what you'd expect from 'activation of concepts while asleep'.

There are, of course, [some 'dream sceptics' out there](https://philpapers.org/rec/MALDAS) \- people who take dream reports to be essentially post hoc confabulations that reflect, e.g., the rapid updating of an internal model that the conscious mind has to accomplish upon waking. But I don't buy this line of thinking. Part of my resistance is just that my dreams are frequently so intense and vivid. You might as well try to convince me that I'm a philosophical zombie for half of my waking life. But this kind of scepticism also strikes me as simply kicking the explanatory can down the road: we're still left with massive puzzles about why dream reports are ubiquitous and a robust cross-cultural phenomenon, what the hell is going with lucid dreaming, why dreams have the content they do, and why there's so much inter- and intra-personal variation in dream reports. If we're going to buy a massively counterintuitive premise, I at least expect some big explanatory rewards.

So, consider this an invitation to the sub for y'all to share your knowledge, theories, wild speculations, and personal experiences concerning dreams. Any insights appreciated, especially if they help me avoid embarrassment when I wake up from the simulation and everyone finds it hilarious that I didn't notice the Easter Egg.","What the hell is going on with dreaming?

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of February 04, 2019

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

">I think that as a human, I could very well be much more at peace with myself if I held true to an open-minded outlook on the whole enchilada that exists here in front of me unmovingly. 

&#x200B;

# Its Continual in a Repetitive Timeline. 

And for this is exactly why I have come to see differingly:

&#x200B;

Mankind has deemed his continuity for provoking the ever-growing development of new technologies as a gesture of extraordinary progress. And surely, the chapters that litter our corridors depict very curious and fascinating articles. But are the considerable interactions that I have made in attempt to pursue the uncertainty not simultaneously warranting regression (to an earlier primitive state of ignorance)? I mean, come on—Religion & politics enacted through acts of extremism. Human interactions with the environment. A well-disturbed society and its strange advocacy for change—there are indefinite controversies that bridge this entire mishappening. 

Sure, most of the time I may be apt to think in a totally objective manner. And yeah, I have probably accommodated myself to the comfort of a rather subjective approach in other instances.—Regardless, by the society's conduct, there will always be a genuine array of us people who are solely trying to make what living they can. This is a wonderful thing, that we are all capable of serving our own purposes, whether it be with an intent of malice or even with an aspiration to become involved in the conservation of our environment in its entirety—No matter what degree of importance my pursuit may possess, I still have in my possession a uniquely-functioning brain that no one else does.

But does this all really matter? Should it matter? Will it arouse a substantial shift in my audience's attitude, or perhaps in their physical state of well-being? Because when I address this *enchilada* in full regard, it appears that I am only an animal, and as any another will succumb to an inevitable extinction. And then at the end of the day, it seems to have not a single trouble in reclaiming all that has been taken.

"*Some preliminary term definitions before beginning*

**Ego**: That thing which believes it is in control, the reality-integrator. 

**Impulse**: Freudian *Id*, drives, what Jordan Peterson describes as those ""sub-personalities"" associated with hedonic gratification.

**Super-ego**: The personification of the individual's notion of what is best for it.

I am looking for advice, concrete and conceptual, on how to enact new habits which will improve my wellbeing. As something to aim for I'm using a slightly expended version of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). It's probably not perfect but it's the best approximation I have of that which, if done correctly, will help me live my best life. 

Background: Using the HoN as a starting point I already have many of the lower-level factors covered. But with a move to a new country and starting self-employment in early 2019, I'm taking a hard look at how to inject more structure in the days. The cost of living will be low enough that eking out a subsistence living sets a pretty low bar, so the potential harm from getting depressed and staying indoors on my computer all day is significant enough to worry me.

To get the conundrum mentioned in the title, I'm trying to figure out the best method for getting myself to reliably execute habits that are difficult yet build long-term wellbeing, such as exercise, healthy eating, mindfulness meditation, positive mindset, self-study of the local language and more. The problem is by no means unique. As I see it, **there are two classes of solution**: The first involves investing the ego with the responsibility to carry out the good behaviors; and the second relies on subordinating the ego to an external plan. There are problems with each approach and I'm not even sure if my representations approximate reality well enough to be useful, so that's why I am writing this post. 

Let's back up a bit. Whenever I've tried to do these things in the past, the approach has been ad-hoc. In uni I managed to work out 3 mornings/week even when it meant crossing campus in punishing midwest winters, but the habit fell off after a year. I've done that damn ""I should really start meditating"" thing more times than I can count--even managed to start a few of those times, but it always petered out. Same pattern for many other habits over the years. It's gotten to the point where every time one of the flaccid resolutions to form a good habit fails, I despair because the quest of mastering my impulses seems ever more futile.

*Was I too weak?*, I wonder. *Why can't I be motivated to meditate?* *Were the stakes too low?*

All signs point to a problem with the paradigm of ""Ego should be powerful enough to wrangle unruly Impulse."" It's like the parents went out and left the oldest sibling with a list of chores to have the gaggle of younger brothers to do, except oldest sibling is nowhere near able to maintain order.

Let's take a leap and say there are no grave flaws with my metaphors and structural-psychologically oriented view of agents within the Self. What could potential solutions look like?

**Case 1:** Invest the ego with the responsibility to carry out desired habits. At first, adherence to the habit will be imperfect, but that's okay. Mistakes are admitted as part of the individual's nature but attempts should be made to restore any damage done to the ideal. For example, if I miss a workout, I should try to be in the mindset of making up the loss by going for a jog later. Importantly, the jog is not punishment for failure but rather a constructive restoration of innate imperfection. 

Open questions: To what extent can mere self-forgiveness substitute action? What if the ""tolerant"" style leads to weeks of dropped workouts and no improvement in attendance?

**Case 2:** Who says intrinsic motivation is better? Extrinsic has always been more effective, at least for me. It's certainly been easier to keep a schedule in the context of school and employment. What if it were possible to invest an external agent with the authority to compel me to carry out good habits?

What if the super-ego could be conceptualized as external, like a universal ideal? Is this why people need or at least find use in the notion of God? In this mode, a plan is made with the guidance of the super-ego to pursue that which is ultimately best for the thriving of the individual. Every hour of the day is scheduled, with allowances for free time. The ego uses its capacity for submission vis-a-vis the ""plan"" and there is never an excuse to say ""I don't know what I should do now."" 

In such a strict worldview, failures have no place. To the physicist, however, says the engineer: ""But failures *will* happen, what then?"" Honestly, I don't have an answer to this, only two competing hypotheses. Failure could be treated like in Case 1, where it is forgiven and reparations are made. Or it could be punished. But how do you reconcile a philosophy that says ""submit absolutely; thus there is no room for failure"" and one that says ""failure is natural""? In my experience, self-flagellation for failure to meet an ideal standard only leads to misery, which weakens the hold of willpower and strengthens the need to binge whatever brings pleasure in the moment. As an example, you are tempted by a plate of free cookies to break your diet goal for that day. Feeling guilt and self-reproach, you are compelled to eat two more cookies because that makes you feel better for a bit.

If only the Super-ego could be in control all the time! ""Stunned revelation"" would be a decent description of what I felt when I watched the [scene in the Venture Bros S04E14](https://imgur.com/g1jTJIK) when they go inside Rusty's mind and find his super-ego imprisoned in a cell. When called upon, the figure calmly and with seeming omnipotence opens a door to where Dr. Orpheus need to go. Super-Rusty's imprisonment in spite of his power appears laden with meaning that I won't attempt to unravel here except to wonder what ""the Rusty"" would look like if his super-ego ran the show. That would surely be better for him, but the reality is that the Ego runs the show most of the time. Or at least it thinks it's running the show. 

It's with these musings that I ask the Rationalist community for guidance. How do I approach the problem of self-mastery in a way that (a) ensures habits are carried out with acceptable consistency while also (b) preserving self-esteem?

"In a recent thread where I asked you all for some life advice, a few of you expressed some pleasant surprised that I was (mildly) autistic but married, and one of you asked if I could share any basic tips about social skills stuff.  Since y'all helped me out there, I wanted to return the favor!

&#x200B;

**About Me:**

I fall on the autism spectrum.  When I was little, my fine motor skills were so bad that I couldn't draw basic shapes or catch a ball.  In elementary school, I had a natural facility for language, but I struggled with conversation because I didn't understand the people I was talking to or what they wanted.  Well into adolescence, I couldn't make jokes that other people found funny.  In high school, my academic skills got me some respect, but in other settings, I was a low-status loser and the butt of my friends' jokes.  When I first got to college, I often accidentally came off as a creep in my interactions with girls.  But since then, my social skills have improved dramatically.  I can comfortably pass for neurotypical in most social settings.  I'm able to adapt fairly quickly to new social and cultural contexts and exploit their quirks to achieve my goals.  And even though I don't have a high income or a particularly glamorous life (in some ways, I'm sort of a fuckup), I'm very happily married at 27.  So, I hope that I might have at least a little insight to share in this area.  I expect that this advice will be most useful to people who are more intelligent or intellectually curious than the norm who also have poor social skills-- the ""high-functioning"" autistic and the neurotypical population's nerds. 

&#x200B;

**Heuristics for Social Skills:**

&#x200B;

1: Good social skills are almost always context-sensitive.  Many social norms and ""rules"" are culture, subculture, or situation-specific.  Navigating the world well requires you to cultivate genuine understanding; following a rigid list of rules will often eventually get you in trouble.  So, what I'm offering here is a set of guidelines to help you approach the problem of understanding and mastering social interaction rather than a set of simple prescriptions.

&#x200B;

2: You need to reject the common alief that authenticity requires spontaneity and that prepared or practiced communication is inherently dishonest.  People who live in societies with modern communications technologies developed this intuition for a good reason-- advertisers, politicians, and PR people are constantly trying to sell them various lines of bullshit with carefully considered and tested speech.  But if your social skills aren't already sharp, internalizing this conception will be poisonous to you; it will actually prevent you from reaching a point where you can express your true intentions correctly.  If you want to break this intuition, it might help to read books about or from time periods when most people thought differently.  From the Renaissance into the 19th century, rhetoric and persuasion were at the beating heart of Western humanistic education. Castiglione's *Book of the Courtier* celebrates cultivated communication skills as the most important of a virtuous courtier's attainments.  And books like *Pride and Prejudice* are all about how characters' thought-out statements can express their true nature more accurately than their thoughtless off-the-cuff remarks.

&#x200B;

3: Think of your own communication not just as a way to transfer information along a single band, but as a tool for accomplishing and changing things in the world.  (JL Austen's theory of ""performative utterances"" is helpful for this.)  What you say and what you're trying to accomplish will communicate a lot of meta-level information in addition to its own content.

&#x200B;

4: Aristotle's approach to rhetoric offers a good introductory framework for thinking about effective communication.  He argues that effective speech has three key components-- *logos* (what we'd think of as internal coherence or logical argument), *ethos* (information about the speaker which helps to establish authority and trust), and *pathos* (emotional appeal).  Rationalists tend to be averse to appeals to ethos and pathos (the ""dark arts""), but these aspects of speech serve useful social functions!  It's easy to construct a logically coherent argument with false or misleading premises, so establishing ethos shows your audience why they should trust the grounds for your statement.  Pathos, meanwhile is a tool for helping your audience recognize the relationship between your arguments and their values.

&#x200B;

5: A successful social campaign requires you to understand your discursive battlefield.  Your strengths probably include research, observation, and pattern recognition.  Systematically study the social scenes which you interact with in your day-to-day life and try to figure out how you and other people you meet fit into them; use charts or diagrams if it will help.  Start reading in the social sciences to acquire models which you can use to start making sense of your everyday social life.  I would especially recommend digging into qualitative social sciences like history, anthropology, and sociology, which have a somewhat richer variety of explanatory concepts than fields which have to reduce the world to mathematical models (trading off against precision.)  If you can, try to think about your social circle like both an ethnographer and an economist.

&#x200B;

6: Prioritize understanding concepts like status, face, and honor, and incorporate them into your analysis of your social circle.  Doing something that causes another person to lose one of these is a fast way to make an enemy; helping others preserve them will earn you their gratitude.  Erving Goffman's *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life* is really helpful for grasping these.

&#x200B;

7: If you know that a tricky interaction (like a job interview or a first date) is coming up, develop a plan for it and practice.  As in war, your plan won't survive contact with reality unscathed, but you'll have a jumping-off point for your improvisations instead of flailing.

&#x200B;

8: Be very careful about treating things that other people care about with contempt.  Take the time to learn at least a bit about sports, contemporary pop culture, and what work is like in different sorts of fields, so that you'll have something to talk about with most people and so that you'll be able to ask well-formulated questions which will help other people express themselves, show off, and help you to learn more about them.

&#x200B;

9: Looking good will give you a lot more room for error in most interactions.  You can't change your genetics, but you can make the most of what you have.  Get a sharp hairstyle that's socially appropriate for your workplace (any barber with good yelp reviews can probably help you out with that) and start doing some kind of strength-intensive exercise (if getting out to the gym is too much, start with doing squats, push-ups, and sit-ups at home.)  Fashion is an extensive knowledge domain, and like good social skills, good clothes are context-sensitive.  Again, systematic study is your friend; learn how to taxonomize and combine clothing items and outfits by reading about fashion and studying lookbooks and inspo albums.  If you're a guy like me, the Men's Fashion Advice subreddit is a decent place to start, and StyleForum is a good place to start acquiring deeper knowledge.  

&#x200B;

10: A great way to break out of typical-minding is to read memoirs and psychologically rich works of literature by people whose minds are fairly different from your own.  A lot of ""classic"" lit got that label by being psychologically insightful as well as stylishly written; reading it will help you learn.

&#x200B;

11: If you can, try acting (even in minor parts) in college or community theater, or join an improv group.  This will force you to be mindful about how you move and speak, and will help you deliberately practice those skills.

&#x200B;

12: Journal and think introspectively about your own feelings and emotions; communicating about those things with others is a helpful tool for creating intimacy.

&#x200B;

13: Accept that romantic success or failure is a domain that's largely independent from other parts of your life.  Other people will make decisions about whether they want to fuck or date you based on whether or not they take pleasure in spending time with you, the level of emotional intimacy that you can cultivate with them, and whether or not they find you physically attractive; your other achievements, your intelligence, and your moral worth only shape the outcome insofar as they affect those things.  

&#x200B;

14: In the process of learning, you're going to wipe out sometimes, and that's okay.  In some areas, like asking people out, most people are rejected most of the time.  Accept your failures, learn from them, and remember that you can keep growing.",Heuristics for High-Intelligence Low-Social Skills People,amhcka,new,69,152,152,0

In the [May 2017 links post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/09/links-517-rip-van-linkle/), Scott linked to a kerfluffle that happened in the art world:

> You’ve probably heard of Vantablack, the “world’s blackest pigment”, and seen [the creepy pictures](https://www.sciencealert.com/this-object-has-been-sprayed-with-the-world-s-blackest-pigment-and-it-s-freaking-us-out). But it’s proprietary, it requires special equipment to apply, and you can’t have it. But now artist Stuart Semple has released [an open-access version](http://www.boredpanda.com/world-mattest-black-art-material-black2-0-stuart-semple/) that anyone can use – except, presumably, [Anish Kapoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Semple#Conflict_with_Anish_Kapoor).

In slightly more detail:

1. Company develops vantablack, which uses some advanced technology involving carbon nanotubes to create the blackest black, with scientific and military applications. Anish Kapoor buys exclusive rights for use in art.
1. Stuart Semple takes exception with exclusivity and responds by attempting to make the world's blackest paint.
1. Semple sells to all the artists of the world—[except Anish Kapoor:](https://www.culturehustleusa.com/collections/potions/products/black-v1-0-beta-the-world-s-mattest-flattest-blackest-art-material):

> *Note: By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this material will not make it's way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.

I suggest you don't buy black 2.0. Without the super special awesome carbon nanotubes, it's not dark enough to get make three-dimensional shapes appear flat ([e.g.](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/58da72502dfbdb24008b4928-1283/undefined)). It's perhaps somewhat darker than what you could pick up at your local craft store, but makes a lot of compromises in cost and non-color paint quality to get there. The top Amazon review is titled ""Kind-of a bummer to be honest""

Enter black 3.0.

If you took the 2017 or 2018 SSC survey, you might recall the [spinning dancer illusion](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Spinning_Dancer.gif). To recap: when you look at the illusion, you probably see the dancer spinning either clockwise or counterclockwise but, with some effort, can see the dancer as rotating the opposite direction. Scott brings up these results in [Why Are Transgender People Immune To Optical Illusions?](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/28/why-are-transgender-people-immune-to-optical-illusions/) and [Can We Link Perception And Cognition?](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/14/can-we-link-perception-and-cognition/).

A low-priority goal of mine is to black out my bedroom to the point night and day are indistinguishable. (I'm 95% of the way there and already, my sleep is noticeably better. This is very obviously not blinded and is one of several things I tried at the same time; ymmv.) I'd ruled out painting the walls black for a number of reasons, but black 2.0 always stuck with me as a potentially useful tool so, when I saw a video on black 3.0 (then in beta) happen across my YouTube recommendations, I checked it out.

[Spinning dancer illusion is at 3:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PSaGS5i1Yw&t=237s).

My first reaction is that, while a major step up from black 2.0, you needed the nanotubes to make the illusion work with an IRL object. Then I looked at the stick that was rotating the head and it was spinning the wrong way.

(In case this intrigues you and you want to buy black 3.0, it's out of stock and not expected back in stock until September. Also, in this as in all things, wait for the reviews. Black 2.0 did something new in an interesting way but the actual result fell well short of the hype. ETA: if you like rolling dice, take a link to the [Black 3.0 Kickstar](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/culturehustle/the-blackest-black-paint-in-the-world-black-30); h/t u/megawidget)

Black 3.0 should come with a bunch of non-color paint-quality improvements, thanks to some beta testing. Of relevance to SSC, Semple's beta testing involved collecting personally-identifiable information on human subjects, but did not get approved by an IRB. I assume that everyone said everything they wanted to say between the [initial post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/29/my-irb-nightmare/) and [followup](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/31/highlights-from-the-comments-on-my-irb-nightmare/), but I suppose that if anyone has thought about it more deeply and has new insights since then, you now have a live comments section to leave them in.",Black 3.0,amh6b9,new,25,56,56,0
"First - note that I never say what I think any conspiracy *is*. That's not the point. You don't even need to come up with one yourself from my example, though it's probably useful for analysis. That's what I do. I don't ""believe"" anything. I see intractable mathematical problems butting heads with consciousness. 

If you don't want to read a lot of this perhaps dry analysis, there are two music videos in here. A video was taken from one group and used with another group's song. The video seems only to have been flipped and slowed down. Do the number of 'event coincidences' warrant any feelings or thoughts of conspiracy? ""What"" conspiracy? I don't care in particular. It's more about seeing what thought systems do. 

The title was meant to be provocative, which is perhaps a euphemism for click bait. My example is similar to the [""Dark Side of the Rainbow""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6HHA4y6G5g) phenomena, where, if you start playing Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" at the right point in the credits of ""The Wizard of Oz"", what occurs is a set of coincidences, a few of which some find startling. And I have spent a lot of time wondering how irrational my brain and all brains are being in generating their emotional valences upon such coincidences. There's a list of coincidences in the comment section of that video.

I have the habit of ignoring the emotions after a short time as a way of ""seeing"" the world (except indulging them so I can contemplate them), and then I ask questions like: ""How well is our emotional valence correlated with our estimates in terms of their actual mathematical error, which is intractably complex because it reduces to not just physics, but - according to one model - to a hypothesized ontological substrate, which is somehow ""responsible"" for consciousness itself? My guess is that our emotional valence doesn't correlate well with any mathematically rational assessment of the Universe.""

If that's not clear, it's because I want to be brief here, but hopefully something aroused a few people's curiosity and they can ask for further clarification, which I'll provide to anything I say here. It's not ""word salad"". I have a compression problem I don't know how to solve. I admitted the limitations of my description, and I also said what can be done about it. 

My examples are two music videos. The first one is an unofficial video played with the original slowed down and x-axis flipped, or however you normally say it, along with Royksopp's ""Keyboard Milk"". I would say if you like Tycho or Boards of Canada, you might like this, though it doesn't sound like either of those two in a vaguely strong sense. You could rule out that the video slows down or speeds up undetectably to consciousness (unless you study it or something) by simple measurements, but I'm not going to bother. If the video was stretched, it would seem to remove any chance of conspiracy.

However. Technically even stretching does not prove anything. Imagine there were hundreds of undeniable coincidences - chaotic rhythms that aligned perfectly with flashing graphics for hundreds of consecutive notes. Seems strange to call this a ""coincidence"". This would obviously be engineered. It's not 100%. The likelihood just involves beyond-apprehension probabilities. There is nothing in people's everyday experience that can give them a sense of probabilities expressed by numbers with hundreds or thousands of digits and far beyond. The brain couldn't sensibly encode such contingency even if it could reasonably estimate and then manifest as ""subjective sense"" such orders of magnitude - say an increase in euphoria linearly with each order of magnitude, which doesn't seem entirely ridiculous, but it's still limited. How does the brain create behavior that is different than otherwise because of a 1 in a 10^10^100 chance? There's no way such a calculation could meaningfully manifest in an environment as unpredictable as ours.

The point is that variable-stretching could be introduced on purpose to throw off conspiracy - yes, a further conspiracy. How much stretching is required before we can say things like, ""Well, of course you're going to get so many coincidences via stretching given the 'event levels' of the overlapping media? This was obviously produced by a fan."" 

That may not be clear, so I'll say it another way: If very little stretching went a really long way to create a lot of solid coincidences - that seems to suggest some kind of engineering or inside job, but not necessarily. And if you just say variable-stretching = fan made it all line up, THAT'S JUST WHAT THEY WANT YOU TO THINK. And then one can imagine ""waking up!"" and ""sheeple!"" and the whole culture of such things. Really, there's perhaps no end to the recursion here that a human mind can reach - this functionally-Platonic maze of complexity that is our potentiality, which is to battle in a hall of mirrors - a Universal resonance that bears no fruit but its own existence. But I digress.  

How many videos have substantial overlap? Songs share a lot of structure. With enough people watching enough videos one might get an idea that one video seems like it would be interesting in another song. And lo and behold, there's quite a bit of overlap. But what is the nature of the overlap? How often do you get thematic overlap between videos and music chosen at random? 

All this has to be mathematically defined, does it not? And is there any cutoff that's not arbitrary for conspiracy? Then we again ask ourselves what our emotional valence really means in the face of the technical details.

The next video is [The American Dollar, ""Anything You Synthesize"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSU49AFzgtw&feature=youtu.be). And the original video is by Onesize. I've never listened to this group except this song, which I found because I saw the unofficial Royksopp video first. I like the first half of this song better than the second. Overall I like ""Keyboard Milk"" more, though the title doesn't necessarily bring the best images or feelings to mind if your mind is strange or neurotic or some such.

The question is, given how well the Royskopp song fits with the video - is this delusion? My guess is that some people, or many, will claim there's not enough there. Perhaps ""The Dark Side of the Rainbow"" is more convincing. The questions are what people felt, what their brains did with the feelings and other information, and when this process becomes something you could call conspiracy delusion.

I've heard a bunch of numbers quoted about the the % of variance in IQ that is explained by genetics. However, it seems likely this quoted % ought to vary depending on the range of IQ that you're looking at. For example, it seems pretty plausible that the difference between IQ 95 and IQ 105 is generally environmental, while the difference between IQ 130 and IQ 140 is likely to be genetic, or something like that.

"Remember the [blog post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/04/28/why-were-early-psychedelicists-so-weird/): ""WHY WERE EARLY PSYCHEDELICISTS SO WEIRD?""

This is a relevant excerpt from my [essay](https://chippingawayuncertainty.com/ways-to-reach-mystical-experiences-and-the-risks-that-come-with-them/) on psychedelics where I discuss this issue.

&#x200B;

## Other risks that come with the use of psychedelics

Other than the physical and mental health concerns, what else could possibly go wrong? The odds are high that most of the people who decided to read this essay care a lot about their epistemic rationality. And there seems to be enough powerful anecdotal evidence that after artificially inducing these powerful experiences this extremely instrumentally valuable feature – the epistemic rationality – the ability to form accurate beliefs about the world might be negatively affected.

In one of his blog posts the polymath Scott Alexander after doing a small case study of the scientists who synthesized, studied and consumed psychedelics says the following:

>*“My point is that the field of early psychedelic research seemed to pretty consistently absorb brilliant scientists, then spit out people who, while still brilliant scientists, also had styles of thought that could be described as extremely original at best and downright crazy at worst.”*

He gives three possibilities for this. First is that this observation might be entirely due to selection bias:

>*“you had to be kind of weird* *to* *begin with in order to be interested in researching psychedelics. On the one hand, this is a strong possibility that makes a lot of sense; on the other, the early* *psychedelicists* *ended up really weird.”*

Second possibility is that the first users might have been epistemically vulnerable and unprepared for this intense subjective experience:

>*“I know that almost all of these researchers used psychedelics themselves. Psychedelic use is a sufficiently interesting experience that I can see why it might expand one’s interest in the study of consciousness and the universe. Perhaps this is especially true if you’re one of the first people to use it, and you don’t have the social setting of “Oh, yeah, this is that drug that makes you have really weird experiences about consciousness for a while”. If you’re not aware that psychedelic hallucinations are a thing that happens, you might have to interpret your experience in more traditional terms like divine revelation. Under this theory, these pioneers had to become kind of weird to learn enough for the rest of us to use these substances safely. But why would that make John Lilly obsessed with aliens? Why would it turn Timothy Leary into a space colonization advocate and Ron Paul supporter?”*

As third and for us most important possibility is that these drugs permanently change our personality. Scott points to a famous[ study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3537171/) done in 2011 that shows

>*“that a single dose of psilocybin could permanently increase the personality dimension of Openness To Experience. I’m emphasizing that because personality is otherwise pretty stable after adulthood; nothing should be able to do this. But magic mushrooms apparently have this effect, and not subtly either; participants who had a mystical experience on psilocybin had Openness increase up to half a standard deviation compared to placebo, and the change was stable sixteen months later. This is really scary. I mean, I like Openness To Experience, but something that can produce large, permanent personality changes is so far beyond anything else we have in psychiatry that it’s kind of terrifying. And that’s one dose. These researchers were taking psychedelics pretty constantly for* *years,* *and probably experimented with the sort of doses you couldn’t get away with giving research subjects. What would you expect to happen to their Openness To Experience? How many standard deviations do you think it went up?”*

Following this he concludes somewhat cautiously that psychedelics seem to have a “direct pharmacological effect on personality that causes people to be more open to unusual ideas.”

Confused and concerned by this case study[ I decided to ask ](https://www.quora.com/Why-it-seems-that-psychedelics-have-messed-the-epistemic-rationality-healthy-cynicism-and-critical-thinking-of-intelligent-reasonable-people-such-as-most-of-the-eminent-scientists-who-synthesized-consumed-and)the following question on Quora:

“Why it seems that psychedelics have messed the epistemic rationality (healthy cynicism and critical thinking) of intelligent, reasonable people such as most of the eminent scientists who synthesized, consumed and studied them?”

I was lucky because on Quora the great transhumanist philosopher David Pearce is doing God’s work by bringing light to layman enthusiasts like me. So, here is his full answer which contains much more insights about the relation between the rationalists/skeptics/scientists and the psychedelics states of mind.

>“*Science is piecemeal revelation*.”(Oliver Wendell Holmes)

>Drug-naïve scientific rationalists tend to be unimpressed by the significance of [psychedelics](https://erowid.org/). Real science is hard work. Whether conducting well-controlled clinical trials of potentially life-saving new medicines, gaining a mathematical apprenticeship in theoretical physics, or building particle accelerators to test the Standard Model (etc), good science takes dogged perseverance, critical insight, and a capacity for collaborative problem-solving. Taking drugs and achieving enlightenment would be more impressive if the upshot were profound discoveries to share with the world, or even great drug literature. All too often, heavy psychedelic use makes people crazy – and not fitfully brilliant and insightfully crazy, just nuts.  
>  
>I think this sceptical analysis is warranted and intellectually catastrophic. Here’s an analogy. As a thought-experiment, imagine a tribe of blind, drug-naïve scientific rationalists. A few members of the tribe stumble upon an agent that induces extraordinarily weird, intense experiences – what we would call visual consciousness, though the congenitally blind tribespeople have no words for visual experience. The discoverers are shocked. They experiment further. The raw intensity of these drug-induced states makes their new visual consciousness feel “more real” than former everyday life. Tripping on the mind-altering drug doesn’t confer any enhanced sensory capacities via peripheral sense-transducers; users don’t grow eyes. In consequence, the drug-induced visions deliver no easily digestible payoff to be shared with the tribe’s blind cognitive elite. The experimentalists are convinced that their drug-induced experiences are intellectually important. The experimentalists are of course right – as we outsiders with mature visual intelligence can tell. However, the tribal drug users can’t even agree on *why* the experiences are so significant, which doesn’t inspire confidence in the drug-naïve. Some users babble unintelligibly. The discovery of such an alien state-space of consciousness transcends their conceptual framework. Psychonauts have no shared language to express their mystical visual experience (“*It’s inconceivable!*”). Increasingly, users stop participating in the tribe’s shared cultural, intellectual and economic activities. Habitual users “drop out”, lost in phantasmagorical worlds of visual experience. Naturally, the scientific elders of the tribe take a dim view of such escapism from consensus reality. Yes, taking drugs can induce weird, indescribable experiences. So what? Drug use doesn’t promote greater understanding of the real world. Taking [psychotomimetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotomimetic) drugs scrambles brains, ruins lives and promotes antisocial behaviour. Non-medical drug use is best discouraged.  
>  
>I fear that as sighted rationalists our cognitive predicament may be analogous to the blind tribesfolk. Rather than put our mental health at risk, we settle for an impoverished evidential base. The mathematical formalism of modern physics, quantum field theory ([QFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory)), describes the structural-relational properties of the world. Yet the nature and significance of the solutions to the equations [eludes](https://www.quora.com/If-consciousness-is-fundamental-what-predictions-does-it-make) us. Psychedelics reveal the existence of outlandish state-spaces of consciousness that have never been co-opted by natural selection for any functional purpose. Tools of navigation are virtually non-existent. Human language is a pre-eminently social phenomenon (*cf*. the [Private Language Argument)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/private-language/). Therefore, unlike congenitally blind people who are surgically granted the gift of sight, psychonauts don’t enjoy access to an off-the-shelf conceptual scheme and the linguistic resources to organize their new-found realm of experience. What’s more, genome-editing and transhuman designer-drugs promise to expand the accessible state-spaces of consciousness by many orders of magnitude. Maybe [DMT](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/5gkkpd/dmt-you-cannot-imagine-a-stranger-drug-or-a-stranger-experience-365), [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysergic_acid_diethylamide) and [ketamine](https://erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/ketamine.shtml) users today are just tiptoeing in the paddling-pool end of psychedelia. Heaven knows what future psychonauts will discover, let alone [full-spectrum superintelligence](https://www.quora.com/What-does-David-Pearce-think-of-the-intelligence-explosion-theory).  
>  
>Right now, sadly, these are empty words. A post-Galilean science of mind is still a pipedream. Most of today’s scientists and philosophers will die ignorant, trapped in the invisible prison of ordinary waking consciousness. Forswearing the experimental method, and responsibly encouraging the younger generation to do likewise (“*Just say no!*”), we sleepwalk though life, stumbling our way to oblivion.  
>  
>Here’s another worry. Paradoxically, staying drug-naïve may cripple understanding of our *own* normal state of consciousness. Drug-naïve rationalists are ignorant of how the state-specific properties of the medium of our thought-episodes are shaping their nominal content. Compare dream consciousness. Just as the nature of dreaming is best grasped when awake, perhaps posthumans will understand Darwinian consciousness as a [waking psychosis](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-perception-and-consciousness) that our minds were impotent to grasp from the inside.  
>  
>If this analysis is apt, then the intellectual significance of mind-altering drugs is hard to exaggerate. Darwinian minds are typically overwhelmed by taking psychedelics. Our primitive brains [evolved ](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/dinosaurs-got-high-on-psychedelic-fungus-fossil-discovery-reveals-10040628.html)under pressure of natural selection in an unforgiving environment. So we are intellectually and emotionally unequal to challenge of exploration. That said, not every psychonaut succumbs to flakiness, mysticism or psychosis. Recall the late [Sasha Shulgin](https://www.mdma.net/alexander-shulgin/pihkal-tihkal.html). Sasha devised a systematic discovery-process for the synthesis of new psychedelic agents. He created a rigorous methodology of first-person experimentation. He wrote lucid and illuminating texts documenting their use. Alas, most of us are not so psychologically robust.

"Trends in education seem to be similar around the world (longer time spent in education before joining the workforce, an increasing share of people in high school and higher education), but are delivered in very different ways accross different countries, which doesn't seem to affect results that much. 

Let's take a few countries which delivered great results as far as productivity, scientific and artistic output go: the US, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, France and Japan.

In the US, almost everyone go to general high school, where teenagers get to pick up many different courses. In Germany or Switzerland, a significant (albeit shrinking) share of the population goes into trade schools instead of academically focused high schools. In Japan, high school students study a lot harder than French students. French students in high school are very limited in terms of courses they can select.

When going into higher education, elite American, British and Japanese students go straight up into elite universities, like Oxford, Cambridge, the Russell group, the Ivy League or Kyoto and Tokyo universities. German or Swiss students go to the regional university, which aren't marked by such a stark hierarchy. French best students go to spend the next two years after high school in Preparatory classes, in an environment similar to high school but much more intensive, and then end up passing an anonymous exam, which will rank them between different schools. 

Once in said elite school though, French students work a lot less, because grades don't matter anymore, outside of validating level. Likewise, Japanese students in universities don't work that hard, in stark contrast to their high school years and actual working years. On the other hand, the best American students or British students often work more than during their high school years, and are incentivized to achieve high grades. Swiss or German students have to achieve a fairly consistent workload during many years.

Look at a special trade: med schools. Med school in France starts right after high school. 18 or 19 year old students have to study really hard during a single year, mostly learning a lot of stuff by heart, and succeed in an anonymous exam. If they are amongst the best at the end of said year, they'll become doctors after the next 5 years of university, before taking another anonymously ranking written exam, then about 4 years of residency. In the US, you study general fields during several years in college before a complex holistic admission process and an exam, then get into med schools. It's not obvious though that American doctors are clearly inferior or superior to French doctors.

Likewise, if you look at engineering or law schools, Japanese, German, Swiss, French or American engineers and lawyers aren't trained in the same way at all. But nobody seems to be clearly inferior. Or maybe they are, but it's not noticeable enough to force a reform.

"Hello,

&#x200B;

I'm looking for some direction regarding relevant research/opinion pieces on the above topic. I haven't posted on this subreddit before (despite reading SSC for.... a long time), so feel free to let me know if this isn't appropriate to post here.

&#x200B;

Context: I work in medicine, and more recently I've noticed that patients have started to tell me about how their ""anxiety"" stops them from participating in various parts of society, or stops them from achieving at an expected level. This seems to be occurring more in young people (I often see patients aged 12-17). Purely anecdotal at this point, however I can see how some parts of culture/media *could* be contributing to this.

&#x200B;

I'm aware of most of the concern (particularly regarding the DSM) that the ongoing relaxing of diagnostic criteria has made it much easier to give a clinical diagnosis to people who are probably experiencing relatively normal and functional anxiety.

&#x200B;

What I'm more interested in is how people, particularly young people, seem to be self-diagnosing their own anxiety and integrating it into their identity; ""I suffer from anxiety, therefore... (I shouldn't be expected to do well in this situation, it's not surprise I find this situation uncomfortable, I'm justified in avoiding this situation, etc etc). The narrative they've tended to provide me seems to stem from a sense of helplessness regarding the world they inhabit - ""Have you seen the expectations that are put on me? How can I possibly be what society says I should be? Look at these perfect people on social media?"") etc etc.  Defence against failure, external locus of control, etc etc.

&#x200B;

These people don't meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis, however they seem to have settled into a pattern of behaviour which deems that their discomfort is a valid way to help rationalise their failure to thrive in aspects of life.

&#x200B;

Can anyone direct me to any interesting commentary about this? It's interesting to note a (somewhat subjective...) culture shift; rappers would have been laughed off the face of the earth if they rapped about anxiety 10 years ago, now we have rappers named after anxiolytics who base much of their image on mental health struggles.",Pathologising normal anxiety - both clinically and as a part of an individual's formation of identity,al66a5,new,6,12,12,0

So yesterday I was playing a puzzle game on a mobile similar to a Candy Crush game (it was an old phone I found!).


In this game you smash bricks by moving them around until the bricks stack too high and hit the sky (so its an endless game till you die). But along the way you receive powerups that remove blocks, or all blocks etc. These powerups are given to you *very* regularly and they’re not even a ‘cheat’ per se, just a feature that are expected to be used.


But I never use them. And I mean I realised I don't use *any* powerup in *any* [EDIT- Mobile] game. *Ever*. I never have. At least not until yesterday as I was a while into playing. I was losing, and as soon as I used a powerup (that didn’t even give me a big advantage) I felt bad and quit. It *immediately* felt useless that I had used it and I was wondering why that was.


---


After a moment I realised that by using it, I’ve removed any way of *keeping track of if I’m improving* in the game (or any other scenario). I’ve removed myself from any semblance of tracking progress *against* previous or future scores as I couldn't ever replicate the same conditions, and am just spending a few moments playing a single isolated level that doesn’t offer anything. It felt futile and *truly* a waste of my time (somehow more than just playing the game normally).


I feel I could expand this lesson into many other elements of my life, as '**constant progress**' has been a bit of an unspoken mantra in my life for a long time, and this is only valid if I can gauge against previous efforts. Obviously its a stretch because it’s just a mobile game and of course who cares, but I found it a strange insight to why I do certain things, and why such a simple thing irked me.

"Hey all,

&#x200B;

I've been having a pretty rough time lately.  I'm a graduate student in a humanities field.  Like a lot of people in the same position, I really internalized the goal of getting a tenure-track academic position.  This autumn, I did my first go-around on the job market, and it was a miserable, anxious, fruitless experience.  A secular decline in tenure-track hiring in my field (which never really recovered after the great crash of 2008), the unusual design of my research project (which is between two typical subfield divisions in a way that makes it harder for me to comfortably fit either), and (very likely) my own fuckups rendered my search for tenure-track positions and prime postdocs a total failure.  This event, coupled with a general wave of anxiety and depression which has been creeping up on me for the past two years, pretty much broke me.  I lost pretty much all of my self-confidence and my ability to take joy in life, and had a ton of trouble sleeping and working.

He put me on benzos for a week and urged me to seek more care.  The drugs gave me a bit of clarity and made me realize that I needed to change my life in dramatic ways.  I realized that humanities academia had been making me miserable well before my crisis.  The savage competition for dwindling financial resources, the often-isolated patterns of work, the requirement that you independently manage and juggle a whole bunch of disparate but cognitively demanding tasks, and the extremely long time horizons (which make iterating and bouncing back/learning from failures really hard) had been stressing me out for a long time.  I also realized that even a lot of forms of ""success"" in academia-- like getting a tenure-track job with a high teaching load in a place where I wouldn't really like to live-- would also probably make my wife and I unhappy.  I had to quit academia before it killed me; it would be much better to leave after finishing my PhD at the end of the year than to pursue a series of overworked ill-paying contingent positions and hoping that things would get better.

&#x200B;

I also implemented some other changes (daily exercise, quitting the 4X games which I binged on when I was upset).  When I got back, I also went into therapy, started seeing a psychiatrist, and got an antidepressant prescription.

&#x200B;

I'm still waiting for the antidepressants to kick in fully, but I'm already starting to feel better than I was at my lowest.  But things are still pretty tough; I frequently have episodes of anxiety, shame, and despair, and even when I don't, my energy levels are low and I sleep a lot (perhaps trying to make up for the sleep debt I incurred during my big freakout).  I'm also not entirely sure what I should do with my life, and worried that I'm not going to be employable and/or that I'll never really get better psychologically.

&#x200B;

So, friends, I'd like to ask for your honest assessments and advice.  Am I screwed, either professionally or psychologically?  Am I on a decent path toward recovery?  What else should I be doing to make sure that I start feeling better?  What sort of careers should I be looking into?  And what should I know about transitioning to work in other sectors?

&#x200B;

A rundown on my skills/traits that might be relevant to some of that:  In addition to the sort of skills that I developed doing my research work and teaching classes (writing, public speaking, facilitating discussions, providing feedback and motivation to subordinates, unearthing and synthesizing tons of information, autonomously planning and executing complex projects over long periods of time),  I speak four languages (English, French, Spanish, and Arabic) and I have a BA in math (mostly focused on theoretical, not applied, although I did take a few classes on statistics and game theory) from a top-20 US university (graduated *cum laude*).   I had a knack for coding in high school, but I didn't pursue it much after that.  I have a 148 IQ, and I'm high-functioning autistic (although my social skills are good enough that I can pass well and neurotypical people often think that I'm sensitive or perceptive).

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'm 27, I have no debt, I'm married, and my wife and I have around $70k in savings and investments.  She's also an academic, but she wants to transition out too.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: Smart guy who made some suboptimal life choices hit rock bottom both professionally and psychologically this year; seeking good advice for recovery from a community that's interested in mental health and generally very smart.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Thanks for all your help, everyone!  Feeling a bit more comfortable knowing that I have prospects (and know that I have going to a coding bootcamp and becoming a decent software engineer as an option if I can't get a good job in the next few months).  Some days, I still feel sort of hollowed out/filled with dread, but that's probably just the depression, and it seems to be easing up as I'm getting treatment.",Can things get better for me?,alablp,new,75,22,22,0
"Wellness Wednesday thread for January 30, 2019

The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives. It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and if you should feel free to post content which could go here in it's own thread. You could post:

- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

"[Study in PNAS:](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/01/23/1815129116)

> Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a psychedelic drug that reliably induces an altered state of consciousness. Interest in psychedelic compounds is growing due to their remarkable potential for understanding altered neural states and potential clinical applications. However, there are major knowledge gaps regarding LSD’s neuropharmacology. Using cutting-edge neuroimaging methods we investigated directed connectivity between cortico–striato–thalamo-cortical (CSTC) regions after administration of LSD together with the specific role of the serotonin 2A receptor. Our results provide evidence that LSD alters directed connectivity within CSTC pathways in humans, suggesting that a disintegration of information processing within these loops is underlying the psychedelic state. These results inform the neurobiology of altered states of consciousness with critical implications for rational development of novel treatments.

> An LSD study published Monday in PNAS provides further evidence for a leading theory, suggesting that the brain on LSD trips because it’s experiencing sensory overload.

> It’s well established that the brain can’t process all of the sensory information it receives from the outside world. Sometimes those stimuli are redundant, and other times they’re just not useful. The key “filter” for all that information is a ball of neurons in the middle of the brain called the thalamus. When it’s working correctly, the thalamus weeds out unnecessary information so the brain doesn’t get overloaded, much like Twitter’s algorithms try to present only the tweets you want to read.

"Last week, two documentaries about the infamous Fyre Festival premiered on Netflix and Hulu. Midway through the Netflix [documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9412098/?ref_=nv_sr_1), I noticed that Billy McFarland, Fyre's ex-CEO, has quite a bit in common with Elizabeth Holmes, the ex-CEO of Theranos (they were even represented by the same law firm, Boies, Schiller, & Flexner).

Two data points is hardly a pattern. However, u/dormin111 wrote a fascinating [review](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9w1b19/the_amazing_tale_of_possibly_the_most_successful/) of *Billion Dollar Whale*, an account of Jho Low's perpetration of the 1MBD (Malaysian sovereign wealth fund) scandal (incidentally, they also reviewed [*Bad Blood*](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/8zrhr4/theranos_and_elizabeth_holmes/)). The three perpetrators have sufficiently similar motivations and behavioral patterns that I think we can draw some conclusions about why this type of fraud arises - because two and a half data points make a pattern, right?

&#x200B;

**Disclaimers**

* If you are not familiar with any of these episodes, I suggest you read the relevant Wikipedia entries or book reviews.
* I have no expertise in this field (whatever ""this field"" is - fraud? book reviews? fraudulent book reviews?). If you follow crime stories at all, much of my post may seem self-evident.
* My sources are *Bad Blood* by John Carreyrou, the Netflix documentary ""Fyre"", u/person's two book reviews, and Wikipedia
* I will use HLM when referring to Elizabeth Holmes, Jho Low, and Billy McFarland as a unit

&#x200B;

**Early life: expectations of success**

HLM were born to successful professionals. Holmes' parents were relatively high up in the U.S. government, McFarland's were real estate developers, and Low came from a line of businessmen.

Wild speculation: The magnitude of the fraud is correlated to the family's previous success: Holmes and Low had wealthy grandparents or great-grandparents (though the wealth did not make its way to Holmes), and their frauds were in the billions. I didn't encounter any information about McFarland's grandparents, and his fraud was small potatoes in comparison - in the mid-$10M range. However, I am sure that given the time and the means, McFarland would have pursued ever-larger ventures.

HLM attended prestigious universities and/or dropped out of school. H famously dropped out from Stanford to start Theranos. Low attended the Wharton Business School undergrad program, and McFarland dropped out from Bucknell to start his first company. Though Bucknell does not have the luster of the other programs, dropping out can be seen as a status play: McFarland had better things to do than to stay there. Note that all three are private schools.

&#x200B;

**Career trajectory**

HLM spent little time before settling upon their careers of choice, and they demonstrated an early preference for management. We already covered Holmes and McFarland dropping out to start companies. While Low seems to have been more of an individual operator than an executive, I see no evidence that any of them worked for anyone but themselves in their adult life. Note that this is orthogonal to work ethic - the priority was not to avoid work, but to work on their own terms.

&#x200B;

**Fundraising and charisma**

This is where the fun begins. HLM are fantastic fundraisers. This has to be the case, as we never hear about the would-be fraudsters who fail to convince people to give them money.

At this point, we see a difference between Low and Holmes/McFarland. However, I think this difference helps clarify how all three operated.

Holmes and McFarland both started companies, which means having employees and raising venture capital. In interviews, those employees and investors invariably mention the charisma these CEOs exuded. Holmes wanted to be the reincarnation of Steve Jobs down to the black turtleneck, and one way she apparently succeeded was in emulating his ""reality distortion field"". ""She'd stare at you with those big blue eyes"", ""She can sell anyone anything"", etc. Likewise, Fyre employees cite McFarland's charisma, drive, and aptitude as a salesman in explaining how he raised millions in the months leading up to the Fyre festival.

Of course, it is subsequently revealed that they straight-up lied.

Context about their lies: Holmes had a vision for a product that exceeded current technological capabilities. Rather than face this reality, she continued to pass off wireframe demos as the real deal and silence whistleblowers via litigation. Though Holmes misrepresented partnerships and kept Theranos' financials under tight wraps, lying about financial performance was not a central issue until late-stage investors came on. On the other hand, McFarland had a hard deadline to meet. His only lever was to throw more money at the problem, which meant blatantly making up numbers about Fyre's revenue that would appeal to investors.

Back to charisma. From what I can tell, Low didn't exercise any intrinsic persuasive abilities. He just palled around with powerful people until he found one willing to offer a deal. In fact, it took Low several at-bats to do so. From u/dormin111 's review:

>Low attempted to use his school connections \[to\] be a middle-man between... investors and Malaysian development companies, but to little  avail. He actually did set up a bunch of deals, but kept getting screwed out of his fees. His luck changed when he got close to \[the stepson of future Malaysian Prime Minister\]. With this connection, Low convinced one of the Malaysian kings... to set up an oil-based sovereign wealth for the country financed by Middle Eastern money, and for Low to manage the fund.

No small feat, but not the superhuman salesmanship attributed to Holmes and McFarland.

Does this make Low substantially different? I don't think so. In fact, I would bet that neither Holmes or McFarland are nearly as charismatic as they are portrayed. Why:

1. Careful selection of audience. Silicon Valley is already primed to worship successful founders. A tech CEO in, say, the 90th percentile of salesmanship will receive a lot of praise and coverage. But unlike presidential candidates, a startup CEO need only appeal to a few employees, investors, and reporters. *Bad Blood* states that Holmes had the greatest effect on older, white men, and she carefully cultivated this group.
2. Deception facilitated by delusion. HLM are clearly successful liars. I suppose you could consider this as one facet of charisma, a trademark of the magnetic sociopath. Personally, I think this is just as easily facilitated by a high level of delusion, which we will cover soon.
3. Eye test. Maybe video is different from real life, but the way Holmes presents herself is so alien to my experience that I cannot imagine it not activating suspicion ( u/coswell makes a good counterpoint here). McFarland comes across as chill, though evasive and sketchy in the Netflix footage.
4. A convenient post hoc narrative. So investors got duped and employees unknowingly facilitated fraud. Journalists are looking for a story about where it all went wrong with a young CEO. I think some degree of ""but they were so persuasive"" is inevitable.

You've probably met people who are more convincing than ordinary. If you weaponize this trait with pathological deception and add the right audience and circumstances, I have no doubt it can be incredibly potent. Though the individual deserves some credit for identifying and exploiting those factors, I do not think this makes them a notable leader or fundraiser in general. HLM well spoken people with above-average intelligence who employed antisocial strategies to gain a temporary advantage in status. That is all.

&#x200B;

**Intermission: Henchmen?**

I find it amusing that Holmes and McFarland both had neurotic right-hand men who acted as enforcers and enablers (Sunny Balwai and Grant Margolin, respectively - though Sunny was far worse). Did Low have any such person?

&#x200B;

**Network**

Any venture needs the right network and funding to succeed. HLM took this to the extreme, creating a virtuous cycle in which money and connections fed off each other ad infinitum. They compiled an astounding Rolodex of famous and powerful people (plus Ja Rule). Social proof became a substitute for due diligence in subsequent networking/fundraising iterations.

This is well-documented in all three narratives, so I won't say more here.

&#x200B;

**Denial**

Denial acts in two directions. Self-denial allows the perpetrators to pass deception checks by exuding a sense of success. Group-level denial trims out good actors and leaves only those people willing to keep the scheme going (whether as willing accomplices, in attempt to mitigate damage, or out of necessity). McFarland fired a contractor for pointing out that their initial venue, a tiny private island, could not physically fit the anticipated number of attendees. Theranos laid off concerned employees at about the same pace with which George R.R. Martin kills off characters, to the extent that the depiction of a CFO's firing in the opening pages of *Bad Blood* strongly resembles a *Game of Thrones* prologue.

At this point, I will confess a divergence in the extent of denial expressed by HLM. Per the book review, Low eventually falls into ""anxiety, fear, and paranoia"", suggesting a degree of self-awareness and vulnerability. McFarland reportedly kept his cool until the day of the festival, when he periodically disappeared to drive a four-wheeler around the island as the festival fell apart. However, within weeks of the festival's disastrous conclusion, he had started yet another scam and denied he would ever go to jail. Oops.

Of the three, only Holmes has not cracked. To my knowledge, she has never expressed responsibility nor remorse for defrauding investors, threatening former employees with jail and financial ruin, and risking thousands of patients' lives.

&#x200B;

**Motivation**

It't not about the product. It's about the lifestyle.

*Bad Blood* and *Billion Dollar Whale* both make this point about their subjects, but this is the fundamental commonality I want to outline between H, L, and M.

In so many words, Fyre Festival's marketing contractor put it thus: the real Fyre Festival happened - during its promotional shoot. McFarland paid a few dozen supermodels to party with him and a handful of acquaintances on Pablo Escobar's private island in the Bahamas. Everything was filmed. The video generated immense buzz, because it captured everything Fyre was supposed to be: drinking and dancing with beautiful people on an exclusive beach. At one point McFarland derided ""the average Joe from middle America"" for buying into the dream he was selling, but nobody bought into that dream more than McFarland. He got high on his own supply.

This isn't a fluke. McFarland's previous company, Magnesis, was a ""black card for Millennials"", a credit card promising access to exclusive parties and events. His post-Fyre attempt at a ""company"" was called - get this - ""NYC VIP Access"" (basically Magnesis with an email list instead of a credit card). The guy clearly sees status, exclusivity, and partying as his raison d'etre.

Jho Low? u/dormin111 paints his motivation as a combination of partying (a lot) and a longing to belong to the absurd echelons of wealth he encountered growing up. I guess buying Leonardo DiCaprio a Picasso and single-handedly financing ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" is one way to go about it.

Here again, Holmes comes off as the adult in the room. Though also motivated by status, she was less concerned with partying than with prestige, wherever she could find it: TED talks, magazine covers, and appearances on financial talk shows. It's hard to overstate her obsession with Steve Jobs, and I think she simply didn't consider developing an actual working product as a prerequisite for these comparisons.

&#x200B;

**Final thoughts**

Holmes, Low, and McFarland are bright people with good upbringings who encountered an exclusive and privileged lifestyle. They used their presence and hustle to exploit opportunities to become a part of it. Rather than wait for proven success, they skipped the line and lived off the backs of investors and ordinary workers. The truth caught up to them thanks to reporters and honest employees.

All three were dramatic episodes, as far as fraud goes. I suspect we're less likely to hear about small-time fraudsters in mainstream narratives - though you can find a fascinating summary in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9rscfe/could_you_pull_off_a_big_heist_if_you_really/e8jf8nn). I assume we also hear less about fraud committed by the very wealthy, since they are presumably better at shaping institutions to conceal their activity. Those who capture our attention are the in-between who, like most of us, are trying to get ahead and live a better life. Though I have no sympathy for any of HLM, it's poetic to imagine them striving so high, only to be caught by our institutions and brought down to their place.

Good riddance. Though my post (and all of these narratives) focuses on the founders and fraudsters, we should also commend the individuals who sensed that something was amiss and did something about it - whether talking to a reporter, standing up to a lawsuit, or personally chartering a flight to photograph a festival venue. I prefer to remain a world where reading about these exploits is rare enough to be shocking.","Similarities Between Theranos, Fyre Festival, and 1MDB",aknh0z,new,21,74,74,0
"Could syndicalism work as an alternative to capitalism or socialism as they are generally practiced in the world today? 

Here is an excerpt of a description of the key features of syndicalism, a system of political economy. I'd like to get some reactions before I say where I got this excerpt. 

>Syndicalism [is] the form of political economy in which each business enterprise is owned and run by its own employees.

>… it’s already been tried, and it works. Right now there’s a very large number of employee-owned enterprises in the United States, and an even larger number elsewhere in the industrial world. They are by and large just as successful as companies owned by stockholders who aren’t employees. There are several different ways to set up a worker-owned enterprise—the two most common are the worker-owned cooperative, on the one hand, and the closely held corporation whose stock can only be owned by employees, on the other—and they’ve been around long enough to have had the bugs worked out. 

>... In a very real sense, syndicalism is what happens when you take the basic unit of a market economy—the individual sole proprietor with no employees, who sells the product of his or her labor directly to customers—and maintain the same relationship with the means of production at a larger scale.

>...In a syndicalist society… every employee is an owner. Every employee benefits when the business prospers and suffers when the business takes a loss. Every employee has some influence over the management of the business—the usual approach is to have employees elect a board of directors, which then hires and fires the management personnel. Every employee thus has a personal stake in the business—and every business is owned and run by people who have a personal stake in its success. That’s one of the reasons syndicalism works well.

>Let’s deal with some of the usual questions at this point. Do sole proprietorships exist in a syndicalist system? Of course. An individual who goes into business for himself or herself is the simplest form of syndicalist economic organization:  a business wholly owned and operated by its one employee. A family business—the sort of thing where Mom and Dad own the business and their kids work there—is also a syndicalist business in miniature. It’s when things get larger than that, and there are employees other than the individual proprietor or the members of a family, that the classic forms of syndicalist ownership come into play.
Wouldn’t syndicalism mean that new employees coming in could simply take over the business and throw the founder out on his or her ear? Not at all, because the way you organize a business in a syndicalist society prevents that. Let’s say you’ve founded a blivet-making business, just you and your blivet press, and you do well enough that you need a second employee. You hire someone, and part of the terms of hire are that she gets a share in the business for each year of employment. The business is worth thirty thousand dollars at the time of hire, we’ll say, so she gets, as part of her compensation package, one share with a five hundred dollar face value each year. This cannot be sold or transferred; it remains with her only as long as she remains an employee of the company; but it gives her voting rights in the shareholders meeting and a cut of the annual dividend. A year after she’s hired, she has one vote in the shareholder’s meeting and you’ve got fifty-nine, so she’s not going to be throwing you out any time soon.
By the time she’s put in thirty years, she owns half the original value of the company, but of course by then you’ve retired, and your shares are the basis of your pension. (Your shares revert to the company when you retire, remember—they can only be owned by employees—but your pension makes up for the income.) In the meantime, as the business grows and you bring in more employees, they also start earning shares on the same basis. A hundred years down the road the business you founded is a thriving blivet firm with three hundred fifty employees, all of whom are part owners, and each new employee starts out in the same place as your first hire, working for a year and getting that first share. Again, this was all worked out a long time ago.
Can you fire someone in a syndicalist company? Of course, if they’re not doing their job, or do something that deserves termination. That’s why the employees elect a board of directors, and the board hires management: so there’s somebody who’s not on the shop floor who can take responsibility for hiring and firing, and the other tasks management has to do. A management team that tries to offshore jobs to Third World sweatshops is going to be out on its ear in a hurry, of course, because the board of directors has to worry about being thrown out by vote of the employees; in the same way, any board of directors that tried to pay a management team the kind of absurdly kleptocratic salary packages that management thinks it deserves in today’s America had better empty its desk and pack its bags in advance. When every employee has a personal stake in the success of the enterprise, though, firing somebody who’s not pulling their weight, or is a problem in some other way, is rarely a controversial issue.

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of January 28, 2019

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/slatestarcodex's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.

"Let's say you wanted to create an ideal website with a community full of ideological diversity and where almost all discussion is likely to be controversial or contested in some way. How would you address some or all of the following things?


* Moderation
  * How strict or lax should moderation be? Should some parts of the website be strict and others lax, or should it be uniform?
  * How would you try to find moderators who are unbiased and impartial?
  * What core rules would you set, and what (rough/average) ban lengths would you set for breaking them? How should ad hominems, off-topic (but benign) discussion, and general ignorance be handled? Tribalism / ""boo outgroup""-ing? What about racism/sexism/etc., including jokes?
  * Would you implement Scott's ""if you make a comment here, it had better be either true and necessary, true and kind, or kind and necessary"" rule?

* Culture and user acquisition
  * What attempts, if any, should be made to keep the culture ""pure"" or close to its original state?
    * Let's say you wanted to keep most of the userbase as ""rationalist-adjacent"" as possible. To what degree should that be enforced? Should bans only be issued for explicit rule violations and not ""you don't belong here""-type enforcement? Should staff actively try to purge users who don't seem to fit the community culture - for example, if they use certain undesired terms or seem unfamiliar with terms or concepts commonly known to the ideal user?
  * Should there be some litmus test or message that a user is required to get past or read before they post for the first time?
  * Where should the website be linked/advertised, if at all?

* Transparency
  * Should all moderator actions (warning, banning, post deletion) be publicly visible in a central place?
    * If so, should the moderator's name also be visible?
  * Should all reports be publicly visible in a central place?
    * If so, and if posting is non-anonymous, should the reporting user's name also be visible?

* Structure
  * Assume a model of boards/sections, threads, and posts. Should threads have a post maximum or time limit? How many boards should there be in relation to the number of users?
  * Assuming you wanted multiple boards, how much should boards or board categories be sub-divided?

* Anonymous posting options
  * Anyone can post without registration; no posts have a username or other sort of identifier attached.
  * Anyone can post without registration; posts have a randomly-generated identifier, color, or image attached to them which is unique to their IP address or cookie, to preserve anonymity but also allow post attribution within a discussion (unless someone switches IP addresses or cookies).
  * One of the above, but users can optionally attach a name to their posts if they choose (with anonymous as the default).
  * Registration is required and all posts have usernames attached, like reddit and most other websites.

* High-quality post visibility options
  * Mods could link to their favorite posts every day or week.
  * Posts could be nominated by users, with a poll to vote for favorites (or the poll has users evaluate each post as ""high quality"" or ""not high quality"").
  * An upvote/downvote (karma) system.



More open-ended: let's say you were the creator and administrator of a website like this and had the technical skills to add or remove whatever features you wanted. What would you do? How would you create it, attain users, and run it? How would you handle moderation and finding moderators? Should you try to prevent ""Eternal September"" type situations, and if so, how?

I have some experience with web development, and I've started work on a discussion website which somewhat models the CW thread. The website is not affiliated with SSC or this subreddit. My goal is to create a similar-feeling discussion site with high-quality and insightful conversations, and to experiment with different ways of communicating ideas.

If anyone's interested in directly helping out with the site, feel free to DM me. Otherwise, I'd like to keep specific discussion about it minimal in this thread, and focus on the general ideas.",How would you design a website with an ideologically-diverse community?,ak4d0w,new,24,30,30,0

"In online conversations it's common for me to come across people who are surprised at the idea that, in this day and age, anyone with internet access and half a brain can countenance the idea of a God. Often times these people are amiable and ask honest and valid questions to better understand the position of the informed theist, even if I still get the impression that they're tickled to have the chance to do so in $current_year. Other times they are not so open-minded, and phrases such as 'bronze age', 'cavemen', and 'sky wizard' come out.

How quaint, the line of thinking seems to go, that I take seriously the prospect of a Creator, deeply concerned about humanity, existing outside of time and space, and capable of changing reality at will; an overarching purpose for the universe; an afterlife. Don't I know that the universe came into being due to fluctuations in the quantum foam, or failing that, am I not at least familiar with the Big Bang? Have I not heard that humanity is an insignificant organism inhabiting a layer of scum on a ball of rock orbiting a mediocre star in an unfashionable section of an unremarkable galaxy? Isn't it obvious that the concept of an afterlife is just wishful thinking? A crutch for bewildered early hominids unable to cope with the harsh truth of their own mortality?

*Isn't it time to put away childish things?*

An interesting trait that I can't help but notice about many of these people is that they will react as above, then turn around and discuss the [Simulation Hypothesis](https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html) with complete earnestness. And why not? It makes perfect sense.

Incidentally, if it's true,

1. Our universe was intentionally created by a conscious entity or entities

2. These are quite possibly transhumanly intelligent and beyond our comprehension

3. They exist outside of space-time and are effectively omniscient

4. At the very least, our universe exists for some purpose

5. It's entirely reasonable to suppose that the observation of intelligent life may be a primary goal of the simulators

6. Indeed, it's entirely plausible that we are, to some degree, made in their image

7. The apparent vastness of the universe is no indication that Earth and her inhabitants is not the focus of creation and the attention of the creators (due to the possibility that everything else we see is simulated at extremely low-res or else projected for our benefit)

8. Such creators almost certainly have read/write permissions and can edit as they see fit

9. They're also almost certainly capable of transferring copies of people (and other organisms) into other simulations run on the same or other substrates

The only two that I want to comment on for now are #7 and #9.

In the theist view, the size of the universe in #7 isn't an issue because God isn't short on resources. Why not make a vast and majestic cosmos? I doubt he's using two digits for the year, either.

Also, regarding #9, I'm fascinated by the idea that, depending upon the moral requirements of the simulators, they may actually be obligated to provide some sort of afterlife. At least, I can imagine this being a thorny issue should our race ever become capable of spawning sub-realities full of sapients.

Now, there is of course a difference between gnostic theism and hypothetical simulationism, and the validity of the latter isn't ammunition for the former... Except when fending off the folks who can't resist lumping Gods in with faeries and unicorns.

Anyhow, it's my hope that this conceptual bridge proves useful for some people.",Gods and Simulators,ajxu4q,new,156,40,40,0

"I feel as if this question doesn't belong in the CW thread because it's not chronicling the events of our current CW, but is a larger meta question about human history itself. 

The question occurred to me last night. I wonder exactly *how often* culture wars turn to widespread violence, on a historical frequency basis. Certainly every case of genocide counts as an example, Bosnia, the Tutsis, the Armenians, Hitler, etc. But then I started thinking about other major culture wars that didn't turn to systemic, large scale violence.

The civil rights movement in the 1960s came to mind, as one that while experiencing sporadic violence, and certainly burdened with historical violence over a long period, was ultimately resolved largely without large scale bloodshed. But at least one of the two sides in that featured a charismatic leader committed to peace, and dedicated to such peace because of deep religious indoctrinations. I'm not sure our current CW has a figurehead like that on either side, and the peacenik indoctrination layer has proven ablative, and worn away.

So that raises the larger mathematical question. Is there a list, database, or similar, of culture wars worldwide, that I can query? For the sake of argument, let's define culture war broadly, to include any clash between groups of people with deeply different bundles of genes and/or indoctrinated memes, not the narrow definition of ""trads v progs in the west."" Let's also exclude wars of nationalism, so Japanese v Chinese wouldn't count.

I'd like to maybe analyze this question, but I don't think my background in world history is good enough to compile a list of culture wars on my own. 

The back of the envelope list I cooked up last night: (20th Century plus, so Colonists v Native Americans doesn't rank)

Bosnians v Serbs

Turks v Armenians

Kurds v Turks

Sunni v Shia 

Hutus v Tutsis

Nazis v Jews

Red Tribe v Blue Tribe USA

Civil Rights Movement USA

He's clearly owning his own decisions, he states his observations and his plans, and it's up to them how they want to respond.  But he's neither attacking them nor pleading for their cooperation.

"[Jesse Singal announced](https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/1088254318241820678) that he had, with Freddie’s permission, reposted several DeBoer essays.

Background: For those of you not familiar with Freddie, I’d describe him as a strongly-committed leftist socialist and a strongly-committed civil libertarian who is not shy about critiquing both the left or the right. [After some struggles with mental illness and false accusations against others](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9kt9dj/freddie_deboer_has_apologized_for_making_false/), DeBoer somewhat retreated from the public stage. 

DeBoer seems to me to draw particular ire from the Left, partly from some sense that he “betrays” his in-group by critiquing them so sharply. (Though he is definitely NOT on the Right, however, as I think you’ll soon see.)

>This is the problem with the backchannel. When within-group criticism is only voiced privately, there’s no opportunity for the group to evolve, to shore up its weakness, to evaluate its own problems, to correct its own course. And political movements have to evolve or die. It’s a classic cause of political self-destruction, when a group’s inner dynamics become so ossified and conformist that no one is willing to point out the group’s problems. That’s the condition in far too many left spaces today: a near-total inability to point out the cracks in the foundation for fear of being shamed yourself.

[the Iron Law of Institutions and the left](https://medium.com/@jesse.singal/the-iron-law-of-institutions-and-the-left-333c42c246af)


>The Iron Law of Institutions is this: “the people who control institutions care first and foremost about *their power within the institution* rather than the *power of the institution itself*. Thus, they would rather the institution ‘fail’ while they remain in power *within the institution* than for the institution to “succeed” if that requires them to lose power *within the institution*.” [….]

>So take the discourse of freedom, liberty, and rights. This discourse is very, very important to ordinary people, particularly Americans. You can lament that fact, but it is a fact. A radical left movement that wants to win would be careful in how it talks about freedom. To me, the message is obvious: socialism is desirable in part because it’s only socialism that guarantees true freedom, the freedom to live and behave free of want. *We’re* the movement that can make people really free because once in power we can let them pursue their own interests free of hunger, homelessness, and so on.

>Is that the message in socialist spaces? Not at all. In fact if I talk about freedom in many radical left spaces, both real and virtual, I will often be told that “freedom is a bourgeois concept” or something similarly fatuous. The left typically disdains the discourse of freedom — and not in spite of the popularity of that discourse, but because of it. Why? Because of the Iron Law: to be dismissive of freedom might hurt the left movement overall, but because such dismissal is a part of left-wing culture, acting this way elevates you *within* left social spaces. [….]

>I think there’s real problems within the left — theoretical, political, discursive, pragmatic. I say these things out of a deep and sincere belief that we must fix our own problems before we can hope to gain power necessary to fix the world. Some people disagree, which is fine. What I find disturbing is how few other people are willing to take on a role of within-group critic, and how many are willing to excommunicate anyone who performs such a role. Who is allowed, within the left, to tell the left things it does not want to hear? The Iron Law helps explain the absence of such voices. As for me, almost none of the people who most need to hear this message will bother to read it. Instead, they’ll tell the same sad jokes to the same group of the already-convinced, preventing the possibility for effective introspection and reform. And that’s exactly the problem.

I disagree wholeheartedly. First, any dichotomous prediction could have been written either way. This fact alone doesn't make 50/50 special in any way. Second, and more importantly, the fact that the 50% predictions were less well-calibrated than expected means that they can be calibrated, which shows that these predictions are, in fact, meaningful.

Also, since I'm here being nit-picky, a success rate of 27% under a model that assumes 50% is not particularly unlikely. It's nowhere near what could be reasonably described as statistically impossible. In the context of the full calibration curve, it seems pretty good, really.

"I grew up in a very rural part of New York, at the tip of Appalachia. The entire area was very poor and many families, including my own, were recipients of welfare benefits. Most kids from towns like this never go college, and if you had asked me what “the Ivies” were when I was seventeen, I would have hesitantly speculated that you were referring to the vines growing up the side of the gymnasium. Out of my class of seventeen high school graduates, I am one of three to actually graduate from college. 

Years later, once I had moved to the east coast, I was less surprised than disappointed to learn of the classes my contemporaries had taken in school: programming, multiple foreign languages, robotics, and so on. Of course, most of these kids can't write a for-loop or ask for a beer in French, and I'm not sure how much of a benefit their extra classes conferred. 

Still, neither the kids from good school districts or the poor hillbillies were explicitly taught how to think in a structured way — thinking about thinking — and to my knowledge, this absence exists today. I have often begun to feel that many problems we face, both individually and collectively, are less about agreeing about the solution and more about agreeing how to think about the problem. Increasingly, I wish people were taught — at a broad level — the concept of Net Thinking, which yields few results upon some googling, but has many corollaries or synonyms. 

Here is a trivial example: in conversations with a friend, they may vacillate over whether or not to apply for an interesting looking job, and one reason not to do so may be the commute. (I’d be curious to know if others have ever had this same conversation.) 

**Friend**: I don’t think I’ll apply for that job as Unread Email Analyst II, because the commute is 40 minutes from my house. That’s just too long. 

**Me**: That’s a long commute, but your current commute is 32 minutes, so it’s really only an 8 minute difference. They told you this is a VP track position and it pays slightly more — is 8 minutes really that big of a deal? 

Other examples abound, with climate change, renewable energy, or recycling being obvious examples. Folks either seem to think that climate change will destroy the world, or the whole thing is a big nothingburger. These issues all have a net cost/benefit, but most people bifurcate and focus only on either the benefits or the costs and ignore the other side of the ledger. There’s not an obvious reason that these items should be politically associated, but it may be that we’re not getting to kids young enough to teach how they should think about complex problems. If “you need to weigh the costs and benefits” were as dogmatic as “the earth revolves around the sun”, it seems logical that the world would be a better place (holding the Bill of Rights as a given - I am not calling laws into question or engaging in a philosophical hypothetical.) 

I feel that I’d rather have my son learn logical, systems thinking than Portuguese or Python, but there aren’t Thinking Teachers or anything analogous, at least not until college. Why the hell not? Is this a huge structural gap or am I just sick of reminding people to do a little mental balancing?

"My main problem with understanding mathematical proofs is that I don't know how to pronounce those damn symbols and so I can't even begin to comprehend what they are trying to prove without googling that ξ is ""ksi"", and the other letter that is a mirror image of that is something I can't even google.

And then it gets worse because they use H but also ℋ, 𝓗, ℌ, ℍ, and even 𝕳, in the same paper to refer to different things, so how should I pronounce those things differently? ""Fancy-H"" works for the next one but not for the remainder.

And then they put ' on the letters, and that's pronounced ""prime"", but then they put primes all over the place, not just on the top-right but also on the left and/or bottom, and that's different, and they also put dots and small circles, again on every side and corner of the letter. How do I pronounce that?

Is it because most of the mathematicians don't (and learn to not) pronounce their statements in their heads, but, like, compute visually, so when a proof says ""let 𝕳 stand for blah blah"" they are ok, this stands for that now, no problem?

"I've made a habit for a while of deliberately collecting role models. I'll stumble across something about or by an individual who exemplifies an aspect of who I want to be and file it away for later use. There is value in finding examples to pattern things after--always some risk, of course, of lionizing those who don't deserve it or putting people on pedestals, but outweighed by the value of observing good behavior.

I'll start things off by providing biographies for a few of mine, then another list of names worth mentioning, but who I admire for very similar reasons to the others and so do not provide unique bios for.

[Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) is the clearest thinker I know, aside from perhaps C. S. Lewis and Scott, both of whom are mentioned here regularly. He writes concise, compelling points approximately whenever he feels like it, started a tremendously successful business because there was something that needed doing and nobody else was doing it, has learned and jumped between dozens of interesting skills and jobs, and generally seems to live in a deliberate and sensible way. Recommended reading: [Possible futures](https://sivers.org/futures).

[Brandon Sanderson](https://brandonsanderson.com/) knew exactly the life course he wanted to pursue, and did so deliberately and relentlessly. He took a night clerk job at a hotel to give him time to write, then wrote for hours daily until he created something worthwhile. Then he did it again, and again, and again, until he became one of the biggest names in fantasy, while still devoting a huge amount of time to connecting with young writers, teaching, and building bridges within the writing community. Recommended reading: [See here](https://brandonsanderson.com/books/where-do-i-start/).

[Leta Hollingworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leta_Stetter_Hollingworth) was a brilliant educational psychologist and one of the pioneers of research around gifted children, focusing mostly on methods to properly teach them and nurture their potential. She worked closely with leading hereditarian psychologists despite deeply felt ideological differences and generally combined progressive values with compassion and a willingness to follow evidence where it led and maintain a scientific approach. Recommended reading: her Wikipedia page, already linked. Pretty compelling read.

[Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) is the best designer of interactive online learning tools I know of, and has a knack for picking valuable and under-focused subjects and describing them in perfectly clear ways. His games/tools are all public domain, and he puts in a lot of work encouraging others to create similar tools and highlighting their work. I admire both his technical skill in game design and his dedication towards doing useful things with it. Recommended work: [How To Remember Anything Forever-ish](https://ncase.me/remember/).

[Bill Watterson](http://www.calvinandhobbes.com/) had a remarkable ability to capture experiential truth and layer his comic strip with ideas and humor that approached kids and whoever else was interested at their levels. Also notable for his refusal to carry his artistic work past when he felt it would grow stale, allow any merchandising or commercialization of his work despite massive potential profit, or stay in the public eye after he had said his piece. Recommended reading: [his Kenyon College commencement speech](http://www.graduationwisdom.com/speeches/0025-watterson.htm).

"Wellness Wednesday thread for January 23, 2019

The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives. It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and if you should feel free to post content which could go here in it's own thread. You could post:

- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of January 21, 2019

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/slatestarcodex's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.

"I've recently been reading a bit about the role of 'costly signals' in evolution and it struck me as potentially of interest to some people here, particularly in thinking about how it could be applied to human behaviour. To condense things a bit, we can think of animals as engaged in sending signals to each other all the time, often for mutual benefit even among antagonists. Alert calls among birds can indicate to a predator that it's been spotted, and that it might as well give up the chase - sure, it might still catch you, but it's less likely to be successful than if it were to go after oblivious prey. Similarly, yellow and black patterning on an insect or frog can indicate to predators that it's poisonous or dangerous, and hence not worth eating.

One problem with this kind of mutually beneficial arrangement is that it's vulnerable to trickery. Maybe a particular bird decides to start emitting alert calls frequently or even at random. That gives it some extra protection in cases where a predator is coming after it and it hasn't spotted it - the bird might choose that moment to make a random alert signal and thus fool the predator into thinking it's been spotted. Another (famous) case is [Batesian mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry), where a non-poisonous or non-dangerous species adopts the coloration patterns of poisonous species in order to fool them (think of harmless hoverflies taking on the coloration of wasps). You can think of these cases as 'defection' strategies, insofar as they make the mutually beneficial arrangements described above much harder. Predators realise that coloration is now an imperfect signal of danger, so they'll sometimes decide to take the risk and eat a yellow-and-black animal anyway (if they're very hungry, say). Sometimes they'll get one of the mimics, but sometimes they'll get one of the poisonous creatures and everyone loses.

One way around this 'defection' problem is to employ *costly signals* \- signals that are impossible to fake. One possible example here is '[stotting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stotting)', the tendency of gazelles to engage in acrobatic and seemingly pointless jumps and acrobatics while being chased by predators. On one interpretation of this phenomenon, it's basically a transparent signal that the creature is really fast and healthy and can pull off these feats without having to worry about being caught. At that point, the predator can say 'gg fair enough' and go after a weaker animal. The genuinely weak animals either won't be able to pull off stotting, or won't risk it.

Many dramatic cases of such 'costly signalling' can arguably be found in sexual selection. The peacock's tail is the obvious example.  Obviously, a big flashy healthy tail doesn't do an individual peacock any intrinsic good, much like stotting doesn't do an individual gazelle any intrinsic good. But (simplifying a lot) it advertises to females that the peacock in question is fit and healthy and is still alive and kicking despite having plowed resources into pointless fancy tail feathers. There's no risk of 'defection' among inferior males: if you're not thriving, you simply won't be able to grow nice big healthy fancy feathers.

One of the things I find interesting about the peacock's tail, though, is that it's a kind of suboptimal equilibrium that's forced on peacocks by the inability to make honest signals on the cheap. If peacocks could just register with 23andme and get a fitness score badge pinned to their chest, the peahens could make just as accurate discriminations without burdening the peacocks with a useless gaudy tail that makes them more vulnerable to predation. But that's not an equilibrium on offer, of course, and it's only the costly signals that can't be faked.

I think there's a rich vein of applications to human behaviour here, but one obvious one is luxury goods and conspicuous consumption. People want others to think they're rich and successful, and one way to do that is buy largely pointless luxury goods like fancy watches and sports cars. Those signals are not so easy to fake. But they're also suboptimal equilibria, insofar as they force rich people who want to advertise their wealth to spend it on stupid stuff (which in turn arguably has bad consequences for society at large, as well).

A way around this would be to give rich people some kind of hard-to-fake but inexpensive marker of their wealth. I'm not suggesting any genuine social engineering projects here, of course - this is more of a fun exercise in thinking about equilibria and signalling in the human case. But it makes me think of the Roman class hierarchy. To qualify as an '[Equites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equites)' (roughly, minor aristocracy), for example, you had to meet a property qualification, and then you were entitled to wear a particular kind of toga and wear a gold ring on one hand. Of course, I'm sure some plebs tried to game the system by buying a knock-off ring and toga, but if it were well enforced, it could allow people to advertise wealth without having to wear a stack of gold jewellery.

I should qualify all of the above by saying that I'm not a biologist (although some of my academic work is biology-adjacent), so I'd welcome corrections from anyone who knows more than me. But it strikes me as a potentially fruitful set of tools for thinking about both animal behaviour and potentially a range of human behaviour.",Costly signals and luxury goods,ahbdzo,new,45,20,20,0

"The concept of heritability is frequently misrepresented. Here I will explain why two fallacious arguments related to heritability are just that--fallacious.

Fallacy #1: A highly heritable trait is one that is under stronger genetic influence than one that is less heritable.

Why it is a fallacy: Heritability is not the same thing as heredity or genetic causation (e.g. [Hirsch 2004](https://escholarship.org/content/qt1398d56t/qt1398d56t.pdf)), though the two words sound very similar, which contributes significantly to the frequent confusion of their meanings (e.g. [Stoltenberg 1997](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9463077)). Heritability statistics are only useful for their original intended purpose, namely, predicting the response of a trait in a selective breeding program ([Wahlsten 1990](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/insensitivity-of-the-analysis-of-variance-to-heredityenvironment-interaction/E76106A51972E1B4DC6E6907B5590F5D), [Crusio 2012](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/heritability-estimates-in-behavior-genetics-wasnt-that-station-passed-long-ago/78AD9D1A43710A63C31C99F2014A6457/core-reader)). When applied to humans, they are useless, because they depend on assumptions that are extremely unlikely to be met in human populations, because humans are not subject to the same controls of laboratory experiments (Stoltenberg 1997). Moreover, it is now understood that all human traits are caused by both genes and the environment, meaning that assuming that variation can be partitioned realistically into genetic and environmental factors, or that there is an identifiable distinction between ""nature"" and ""nurture"", is now scientifically invalid ([Moore 2003](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=GkMJDdcL7QUC), [2006](https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/96534); [Witherington & Lickliter 2017](https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/478796), [Lewkowicz 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3119494/), [Bowling 2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1202-7), [Meaney 2010](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2009.01381.x)).

Fallacy #2: Heritability is relevant to the malleability of a trait.

Why it is a fallacy: Changes in the environment can affect heritability estimates ([Rose 2006](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/35/3/525/735798)), and heritability estimates are irrelevant to the potential effects of environmental changes on a trait ([Bailey 1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1018395229872), [Wahlsten 1997](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4612-0669-9_4), [Dar-Nimrod & Heine 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3394457/), [Sauce & Matzel 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754247/)).

"History is complicated.

That's not the central thesis of Peter H. Wilson's *Europe's Tragedy*, or at least not what he would say it was, but it might be the biggest theme you come away from it with.

If you're not German, you probably do not know much about the Thirty Years War. You might vaguely recall it was a religious conflict, or that it resulted in the Peace of Westphalia which is *important* in international relations for some reason, or if you *really* remember high school history you might even be able to mispronounce ""*Cuius regio, eius religio*."" You could repeat a joke you saw on /r/historymemes about how the Holy Roman Empire was “neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire.” It was a war that was enormously destructive; some 8 million people died, and millions more were displaced. With a German death toll similar to that of World War II but among a much smaller population, it is the defining national tragedy for Germans, with around 25% of the population of the territories comprising modern Germany dying over the course of the conflict.

One of the tricky things that bedevil the social sciences in pop culture is that a little knowledge about a topic can often be worse than no knowledge at all. Humans and the societies they build are mind-bogglingly complex; surface-level understandings are inherently reductive. OK, that’s by necessity. But then you throw in human tendencies to pattern-match, or frame things through their own ideological lens, or replace a foreign context with their own, and things get warped even further. 

This isn’t just a problem with laymen: Wilson himself notes that much of the history of the 30 Years War was written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an age of nationalism and centralized nation-states, in which a multi-ethnic/linguistic/confessional entity that looked to have been vomited onto a map of Central Europe seemed hopelessly obsolete to historians. German historians in particular blamed the Holy Roman Empire for all the then-current ills of Germany at the time of writing.

The great success of this book is the way it unravels the overarching narratives and simplifications of popular memory of the 30 Years War. Principally this is done through very liberal doses of context; the book takes up more than a quarter of its massive length in addressing both its causes (while stressing its non-inevitability), as well as investing time in the periphery (if you would like to know more about the metallurgy and export of Dutch cannons, this is the book for you). Thanks to engaging writing it rarely drags though, and the drama is compelling. But beyond its immediate subject it stresses the importance of skepticism and careful analysis of simplified, overarching narratives.

**Not Another Holy War**

The spine of the book is Wilson’s argument that the war was not a religious war. That is not to say that confessional differences did not play a role, or that leaders did not see themselves seeking religious goals, but that religion was not the main cause of the conflict, or what kept the fires burning for three decades. Each individual combatant had a range of overlapping motives that included confessional, political, constitutional, territorial, and diplomatic aims.

Take for example the inciting incident: the (in)famous defenestration, in which three of Archduke (not yet Emperor) Ferdinand’s ministers were thrown out of a window in Prague Castle (in what was intended as a reference to a similar incident during the Hussite Wars). If one were to understand it purely in religious terms, it would not be clear why Bohemian nobles took that specific moment to rebel: the Habsburgs had been in control of Bohemia’s elected kingship since the disaster at Mohács in 1526, and the supposedly withdrawn rights they were protesting had only been tenuously extended to them for the previous ten years. I say supposedly, because the religious rights that were at issue had mostly been respected by the previous Habsburg regent, Emperor Matthias (although he did not like that they were essentially extorted from his brother by the Bohemian Estates during the quasi-civil war that had erupted between the family). Besides that, the election of Ferdinand as king went through without any major hitches less than a year previous. To put it simply, the religious status quo in Bohemia had not changed for some decades; a religious cause for rebellion is not immediately apparent.

Nor does religion explain how the Bohemian nobles stormed Prague Castle prior to the defenestration, let in via the treachery of the Catholic gatekeeper. Or why upon breaking away from the Habsburg yoke, the mainly Hussite or Brethren Bohemians decided to elect the Calvinist Frederick V, Count Palatine, as King. And it really does not explain why upon finding that the other Protestant states of the Empire were flatly unwilling to support them, they then appealed to the *Ottomans* for overlordship... although it did produce an amusing theological exercise in which Bohemian priests tried to stress the doctrinal similarities between Calvinism and Sunni Islam. Religion might be a plausible motivation for Denmark’s entry into the war in support of Protestant princes, but it doesn’t explain why they later re-entered the war on the Catholic side. 

Wilson doesn’t discount religion as a factor, just that it was not the primary one. He gives numerous examples of how confessional differences sowed division, or were exploited as societal cleavages by radicals. But he also makes clear that the role of religion was not cynical in nature: all of the people involved were deeply religious, in ways that we have trouble understanding today. Life and politics was suffused with religion, and leaders were sincere in their piety. More importantly for understanding the conflict, he also stresses that the concept of religious “radicals” or “moderates” generally did not distinguish between their fervor, but their stance on religious conciliation and a united church. Instead Wilson uses the term “militant” to identify those actors who most favoured force as means to obtaining religious aims.

Throughout the book there are dozens of examples of individuals and states that crossed confessional lines with their allegiances. One Calvinist peasant named Eppelmann from Nassau went from Dutch to Venetian to Hessian to Imperial service, eventually being ennobled as “von Holzapfel” and retaining his Calvinist faith through the process. France, while being ruled by two influential Cardinals and locked in a mortal struggle with its own Protestant struggles, nevertheless furnished enormous subsidies to the Protestant princes before eventually entering the war on their side. The foremost imperial general Albrecht von Wallenstein had an officer corps that included fellow Italian and Croat Catholics, but he also depended nearly as much on his Protestant Scottish and English lieutenants. While some contemporary propaganda saw the conflict as a holy war, the people fighting it largely did not.

**Holy, Roman, and an Empire (but not in the way you think)**

Wilson consistently defends the Holy Roman Empire as an entity through the course of the book; one gets the sense that he is genuinely passionate about it (he authored another tome about its history). Its 19th and 20th century critics over-exaggerated its flaws and underplayed its triumphs, he contends, and the evidence is compelling. German historians castigated the Empire for its failure to handle Napoleon, pointing to its decentralized nature as a fatal flaw. But if being defeated by Napoleon was a sign of illegitimacy, then it was one shared with every other state in continental Europe. Meanwhile, all through the early modern period the Empire contained and eventually pushed back early modern Europe’s one superpower, the Ottomans. Massive sums were raised each year via  each of the regional parliaments in order to maintain large border garrisons on the Hungarian frontier, and in times of open war each Imperial circle worked together to meet troop quotas. In comparison to contemporary French or Spanish means of taxation and recruitment, it was far more sophisticated and sustainable.

Indeed, the state of the Empire much closer resembles current Europe than the nation states of the early 20th century. There are tangibly modern aspects to the Empire that readers might find surprising. It featured two supreme courts, the first modern postal system, and the Imperial Diet, a central forum where all the various members of the Empire had an equal voice. Warfare between states within the Empire was illegal; territorial disputes were settled by lawyers rather than spears. The court systems were open to anyone: should peasants have grievances about their local landowners, they could and did file petitions for redress. 

One might justifiably observe that healthy, stable empires don’t erupt into massive civil wars that kill 8 million people. But the old perspective of the catholic and protestant princes of the Empire falls apart upon even cursory explanation. When Bohemia rebelled in 1618, the only protestant state to aid it was The Palatinate. Several of the states who would later form the most dedicated opposition to the Emperor, like Saxony, even contributed troops to putting down the rebellion. Bohemia’s resistance was finished by 1621, and the Palatinate pacified by 1623, and it seemed entirely plausible that the conflict would end there. Instead, the conflict flared up several more times, but rarely driven by combatants within the Empire. Christian IV of Denmark, with Scotland and England as allies and subsidized by France, invaded the Empire in 1625 in the name of the protestant cause (despite the fact that few of the protestant princes he was ostensibly saving rose to support him). Sweden intervened in 1630 with more French subsidies. Engaged in the parallel 80 Years War also occurring within the Empire, the Dutch Republic and Spain both provided help to allies where they could. 

That is not to say that the princes in the Empire played no part in the continuation of the war, but they had little control over the duration of the conflict. When the Emperor passed the Edict of Restitution in 1629, the peak of the Imperial success, threatening to confiscate massive amounts of land from protestant states, many of those that had previously remained neutral were drawn in. But the most significant protestant detectors like Saxony or Brandenburg withdrew when the Emperor revoked the edict in 1635. This brought France into both the war against the Emperor as well as a parallel war with his cousins in Spain. The states of the Empire and the still intact Catholic League continued to participate in the war, often through measures forced upon them (enemy and “allied” armies often imposed hugely punitive demands for funds, feed, and cannon fodder), but they did not direct its diplomacy. In the end, peace talks were conducted separately between the Emperor, France, and Sweden. Various delegations were sent from the princes of the Empire, but they played little part.

So why did the Thirty Years War have such an international aspect to it, compared to contemporary religious or civil struggles like the French Wars of Religion or the English Civil War? Part of it was undoubtedly geographical: at the heart of Europe, ranging from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, the Empire played a role in the diplomacy of every nation on the continent. But this doesn’t address exactly why Sweden, for example, would invest such an effort into a conflict which largely did not involve any of their chief rivals. Wilson points out that constitutional issues played a role: many of the external combatants like Spain, Denmark, and later Sweden held fiefs within the Empire, and were invested in how the Imperial constitution affected their holdings. But more than that, the Empire had a political and religious significance unmatched by any other in Europe. It was meant to be the Empire in the original sense of the term; the universal Christian state, the successor of Rome, of whom the Emperor was Christendom’s secular ruler. The external combatants fighting against the Emperor were not necessarily looking to depose him, or dismantle the Empire itself, but rather modify the terms by which they coexisted with it.

**The Artificiality of Narrative**

Historians hate the word inevitable. Determinism is something that rarely exists in academic history, if only because the amount of absurd, or idiotic, or incredible things humans do is so immediately apparent in the detailed study of any subject. Throughout the book Wilson hammers home the non-inevitability of the war. By and large the religious peaces worked. The decades leading up to the war were until recently the most peaceful in Germany’s long history; even those conflicts that did break out, like the Strasbourg Bishops’ War featured decidedly more negotiating than fighting. Leagues of Catholic and Protestant princes formed, but between 1555 and 1618 no conflict broke out. Even after the spark was ignited in Bohemia, they cooperated rather than turning immediately to war, and the flames were more or less doused within five years. Nor was the war’s continuation inevitable; Danish and later Swedish intervention was never certain, and faced considerable opposition within their respective countries. It is entirely plausible that if Emperor Ferdinand II had not passed the Edict of Restitution, the war may very well have ended after ten years rather than thirty. On the other hand, peace negotiations dragged on five years before being ultimately concluded, and could have drawn on longer if circumstances had changed. While the 80 Years War saw its end at Westphalia as well, France’s war with Spain dragged on eleven more years.

The book goes into such great lengths to address convenient explanations because a subject like a three decade war that involved almost every state on the continent lends itself to shorthand. It is much easier to portray the build-up to the war as inevitable, rather than a long series of complicated events with a diverse group of actors with differing and contradictory goals. Similarly, it’s simpler to boil the two sides down to “Catholic vs. Protestant” even though many states fought opposite confessional lines, and just as importantly the soldiers doing the actual fighting cared even less. Wilson doesn’t just apply skepticism to historical narratives; similarly he cautions against environmental explanations for the conflict, noting that while the pressures of the Little Ice Age manifested themselves in the conflict, climatic conditions are not a substitute to traditional explanations for the war’s causes.

The end of the war is treated with the same caution as its beginning. The peace of Westphalia was not a transition to a new world order, the secularization of the Empire, the end of the Emperor’s power, or any such grand shift. These interpretations were projected onto the Peace later. More than anything else it was an end to a long and destructive war, of which the citizens of the Empire were enormously grateful. The first western use of fireworks were in Hamburg’s celebration, and Nuremberg accidentally added to their financial woes when an attempt at a 370-gun salute partially collapsed the city walls.

Wilson refrains from “misery porn”; he does not attempt to undersell the violence, but neither does he overindulge. The length of the conflict made life in wartime often mundane. Though the social order collapsed in some places, for the rest life went on, with commerce, education, and religious celebrations continuing as best they could. Soldiers alternated between long periods of inaction with terrifying close-quarters fighting, and equally alternated between friendly cooperation with neighbouring civilians and vicious cruelty. Wilson recounts an episode where a city councillor of Madgeburg was being savagely beaten by a group of soldiers during the infamous sack, until his young son offered them his pocket money; whereupon the leader broke into a smile and helped the family escape the city.

Part of what makes this book such an enjoyable read is the wealth of asides and anecdotes. They are often excluded or looked down upon by traditional narrative histories (not entirely for bad reasons), but here they richly serve Wilson’s arguments. The history of a subject is a thousand jigsaw pieces that don’t fit together. Forcing connections between them are a somewhat necessary part of writing narrative history, but it is well to remain aware that details are being lost in the process. Wilson is careful to avoid generalizing with the anecdotes he presents, maintaining a careful balance between them and the narrative. And although it is not a “people’s history”, Wilson does not lose the peasantry and the burghers in the story, including them where he can. I personally have lived in an area that was badly scarred by the fighting of the Thirty Years War, and although it is centuries removed I have a glimpse of their struggle through that of my grandparents in World War II.  Historical memory is important because it shapes our modern values and ideals. While not always easy history deserves attention to its complexity.

"In [Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History podcast on the Mongols](https://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-wrath-of-the-khans-series/), he recounts taking a class in college on Genghis Khan where he wrote a paper about some of the economic benefits of the Mongol Empire’s reign, and his Chinese professors gave him a bad grade for overlooking the tens of millions of people the nomads killed to acquire their massive empire. Carlin argued that the Mongol death toll wasn’t the point of the essay and it was unfair to grade him that way, but the teacher said it was morally inexcusable to overlook blatant genocide in this context.

I had a vaguely similar encounter in college, but in the other direction. I took a class on Mongol history taught by a professor who was famous in the field (he had spent years unsuccessfully searching for Genghis Khan’s body in Mongolia), and he used to make good-natured jokes about how one of his TAs was an unabashed Mongol fan. The TA didn’t just think the Mongols were interesting, he genuinely believed they were a force for good in the world, and when giving lectures he would go on at lengths rattling off the accomplishments and stats of the Mongol Empire, only to be occasionally interrupted by the main professor who would remind everyone that the Mongols probably killed a higher percentage of the earth’s population than any military force in history.

I just finished listening to the audiobook of Jack Weatherford’s book, [**Genghis Khan and the** **Making of the Modern World**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan_and_the_Making_of_the_Modern_World). When I started it, I wondered if the publisher forced that rather click-baity title on Weatherford. After all, though it’s a well-written and entertaining account, it is a fairly straightforward historical survey of Genghis Khan’s life and legacy. The book never concisely states what the “modern world” is or how exactly Genghis Khan made it.

But now that I finished it, I think Weatherford may have chosen the title after all, because he is about as pro-Mongol as one can get. And though the book is more of a historical account than an argument for a grand historical/cultural/societal explanation for the modern world, there is a faint outline for such a thing somewhere in there.

Even though I don’t totally buy it, I’ll do my best to explain Weatherford’s argument. I’ll also try to explain how Genghis Khan was so awesome (at least in a purely amoral, achievement-based sense) and why he’s one of the most famous people in all of history.

**Old Mongolia and Temujin**

Genghis Khan, who was known as “Temujin” in his early life (Mongols tend to have one name), was born in 1162 in a *rough* part of the world.

Late 12th century Mongolia probably would have been described as a *shit hole* by contemporary civilized Chinese people. If you factor in wind chill and the Gobi Desert, Mongolia is somehow both the coldest and hottest place on earth. With no resources but grass, goats, and horses, a brutally tough and entirely nomadic civilization emerged. There were no cities, no written languages, no formal education system, and basically no economic production besides the aforementioned goats and horses. The only metal or jewels to be found were stolen, usually from the Chinese is the south. The Mongols may very well have been the poorest people in Eurasia.

Fortunately for the Mongols, they were incredible fighters whose mobility, discipline, and tactics outmatched even the mighty Chinese, which led to centuries of successful pillaging of outlying towns. Unfortunately for the Mongols, like virtually all other nomadic people, they never had the manpower, expertise, nor technology to take walled cities. So the Chinese developed a containment strategy for dealing with their nomadic neighbors. Depending on China’s condition at the moment, they would fight, buy off, or negotiate with the nomads. The smartest diplomats would try to sow dissent in the Mongol ranks and make them fight each other, which wasn’t exactly difficult because…

This Mongol civilization could be categorized as a *low-trust society*. The populations could be nominally divided into tribes/clans which consisted of extended families, though these tribes were further broken down into smaller and smaller family units which nomadically roamed in groups of dozens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands. Occasionally the “Khans” of tribes would call together the warriors to go on raiding expeditions abroad, but most of the time the smaller family groups would ruthlessly harass each other, leading to endless cycles of blood feuds and retributions.

The process of mutual antagonism between these units was so routine that an informal warfare system developed. During part of the year, everyone would implicitly agree to peace, and they’d hang out together and go on hunts and trade horses and do nomad stuff. Then in another part of the year they would launch sneak attacks on each other where the unstated norm was for all the men to hop on their horses and flee, thereby leaving their women behind to be raped and/or turned into concubines, and their children to be enslaved, and their meager possessions to be looted. But then once the men got away, they would form up a war band, wait a few weeks, and attack back, hoping to inspire the same “flee-and-leave-everything-of-value-behind-to-be-raped-plundered-and-enslaved” process.

(One of Temujin’s big innovations that propelled his rise-to-power was convincing his warriors to not settle for raping and looting, and instead chase down and slaughter the fleeing men.)

At first, Temujin grew up as just another random Mongol kid, meaning his father was murdered, his mother was kidnapped, and he was enslaved. For a while, Temujin lived with his mother and six siblings as non-tribal outcasts, making him one of the poorest people in one of the poorest civilizations. He and his mother were said to have worn clothes made of stitched together field mouse skin and ate animal carcasses left behind by other tribes. Unsurprisingly, this process made Temujin a pretty tough guy, and sometime in his mid-teens, he and another brother murdered his older half-brother who had begun to call the shots in their family.

I won’t go into too much detail about the political mechanics of Temujin’s rise to the head of the Mongol tribes, because it’s a blur of tribal warfare, betrayal, and murder that I can’t keep track of. What I want to focus on is Temujin’s vision. Suffice to say, it’s amazing that a random outcasted Mongol accumulated power and rose through the ranks until he managed to unify one of the most disorganized people on earth for the first time in history.

Much like Napoleon, Genghis Khan is best known for his military glory, but arguably his administrative accomplishments were even more impressive.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Vision of Genghis Khan**

After nearly two decades of tribal warfare, Temujin rose to the top of the Mongol ranks. Rather than just become another Khan, he became “Genghis Khan,” which means something like “Khan of Everything.” How did Temujin unify the roughly 1 million tribal Mongols spread out across a vast steppe under a single ruler after centuries of non-stop stealing, murdering, kidnapping, raping, and blood feuding?

The short answer is that he destroyed and rebuilt Mongol society along more rational lines. On the one hand, it seems incredibly difficult to get such untrusting people to put aside their differences and work together, but on the other hand, maybe Mongol society was so chaotic that it was crying out for order.

And that “order” was something sort of, kind of, a little like **meritocratic** **secular liberalism**.

(These are my words, not Weatherford's, but I think that's what he was going for.)

Here’s how it worked:

&#x200B;

1. Meritocracy

Temujin broke down the old family-based social structures and rebuilt Mongol society on unified, but meritocratic grounds. Not only were the tribes abolished, but all tribal subdivisions as well. No longer would people marry or kill each other based on whether they were “white bones” (close family) or “black bones” (distant family). Once Temujin took over, every man, woman and child was simply *Mongol*. No more and no less.

Temujin led by example. When he won his final victory against his tribal enemies and erected his new government, he purposefully filled all his top administrative and military positions with non-family members. And not just any non-family members, but nearly all were men from the dregs of society – the Mongol equivalent of peasants – who had risen with Temujin because of their military skill. These guys were no joke - while Temujin was undoubtedly one of the greatest strategic generals in history, he also may very well have had one of the best lieutenant corps ever as well.

This is a point that I wish the book had gone into more detail on. Basically, my understanding is that when Temujin finally won in Mongolia, he rounded up all the aristocrats in the enemy tribes and executed them, but left the peasants alone. Then he turned around on all of his aristocratic allies and told them that they were no longer aristocrats. *The new Mongol nation doesn’t have aristocrats*. Granted, many of these supporters were given military and administrative positions, but the inherited rights their ancestors had enjoyed for centuries were abolished.

This anti-aristocrat streak was brought to future conquered lands as well.

In one of my favorite part of the book, Weatherford described how European feudalism was basically a warfare system where aristocrats would be super nice to each other while they sent legions of peasants to horrifically butcher each other. So if a lord was cornered on a battlefield, he would be captured and then hang out in a nice castle until he was ransomed; meanwhile the peasants and men-at-arms would routinely torture prisoners to death in full view of enemy armies to inspire fear on behalf of their lords.

The Mongols inverted this process. When they conquered cities, the standard practice was to round up the X percentage of wealthiest people and execute them. They might also slaughter the peasantry too if they put up a fight, but at least the Mongols were generally laxer about it. The result was the Mongols had a tendency to systematically decapitate the social and political systems of the places they occupied, to be replaced by sweet, sweet Mongol meritocracy.

The result was a society where talented, loyal individuals rose to the top. Weatherford gives the sense that Temujin truly did not give a shit who someone was as long as he did his job well. One of his top generals was a guy nicknamed “The Arrow,” because he shot Temujin with an arrow during the tribal wars, but upon being captured, was recruited into the general staff. Eventually Temujin’s military and civil administrations would absorb many of the best and brightest across China, India, Korea, the Middle East, and Russia, paying no regard to nobility, religion, or even disposition, as long as tasks got done.

In their own weird way, the Mongols were uniquely humble as far as empire builders go. They knew what they did and didn’t do well. They knew they had a kickass military machine, so they rode around the world kicking ass. They knew Genghis Khan was god’s chosen ruler, so they put him in charge of everything. But they also knew the Chinese had the best engineers, so they used captured Chinese engineers to build siege weapons and take down Chinese walls. They knew Muslims were the best merchants, so they assembled Muslim merchant caravans to import goods from abroad. They new the Uighurs had a great writing system, so they made Uighur scholars invent a new Mongol writing system. They knew Koreans made great bureaucrats with their paper, so they imported Korean bureaucrats. Etc.

Meanwhile, despite building the largest empire in history, there are precious few remnants of Mongol art, architecture, production, or culture throughout their old imperial territories, not because it was all destroyed, but because they never built any of it in the first place. The Mongols knew they weren’t good at it.

&#x200B;

2. Secularism

According to Weatherford, the Mongol Empire was the first state in history to offer total religious freedom. Any and all religions were not just tolerated, but actively promoted by the Mongol state via tax exemptions and state funding. It’s hard to tell if Temujin and the Mongols came to this stance because they were uniquely *tolerant* or uniquely *apathetic*.

Genghis Khan was a Tengrist, which was the traditional faith of the Mongols. Tengrists believed that the sky itself was the highest god, though there were also various natural spirits in the world worthy of worship. However, Genghis Khan was also arguably sort of, kind of, a little Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim, and Christian, as he went through the spiritual rituals of all these religions and regularly consulted with their holy men.

Dan Carlin speculates that Temujin was playing [Pascal’s Wager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager). We don’t have many records of Temujin’s own words, so we can’t say for sure what his true religious leanings were, but at the very least he seemed open to the viability of every religion he stumbled upon. Maybe at heart he was a Roman-style polytheist who considered all gods as real and existent, and so he may as well appease them.

Regardless of what Temujin actually believed, the Mongol religious tolerance was remarkable. At a time when pretty much every corner of Eurasia was dominated by a religious group which used military power to enforce strict adherence to the chosen dogma, the citizens of the Mongol Empire could worship any way they pleased.

Centuries before the ~~Pope was burning heretics at the stake for expressing true scientific beliefs~~  Spanish Inquisition, the Mongols were hosting state-sponsored religious debates. One Great Khan literally invited a Christian priest, a Muslim Imam, and a Buddhist monk to his capital city, and had them debate a series of theological issues in front of him and a crowd. The monk got off to a bad start as the priest and imam formed a temporary alliance against his esoteric bullshit, but in classic Mongol form, it didn’t matter in the end, because everybody got super drunk and the judges lost track of who said what.

The result of this religious tolerance on the Mongols themselves was a society-wide fracturing. Prior to the start of the Empire, presumably pretty much all of the Mongols were Tengrist, or some closely associated Paganism, but as the Mongols spread throughout Eurasia, they drifted away from the old faith. Sometimes this happened when they conquered a new land and stayed there for a while, so they naturally went local, but it also happened to the Mongols hanging out back in Mongolia or the steppe. They would import craftsmen, slaves, and fine goods from abroad, and basically fall in love with some distant culture and eventually convert.

The spiritual fracturing wasn’t based on social class either; all strata of society adopted different religions. Genghis Khan’s elite military inner circle included Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists, as did his wives. One of the details in the book I found most surprising was just how big of a Christian influence there was in the Mongol Empire. Temujin’s main wife was a Christian, and was said to have a powerful hand in his policies. And after Temujin died, his successor was surrounded almost entirely by Christian advisers, much to the consternation of the other religious groups.

Most surprisingly, this religious fracturing *didn’t* lead to a break down of Mongol society, or at least not for hundreds of years. That’s the crazy thing – Genghis Khan’s religious freedom proclamation wasn’t just a law he slapped on the books, *the Mongols bought into it*.

Weatherford recounts an anecdote of a Mongol warrior talking to a bunch of captured Christian Russians. The Russians were shocked to hear that this warrior was also a Christian, and they asked how he could justify the butchering of his fellow Christians throughout Russia. The warrior replied with something like, “yes I am a Christian, *but first I am a Mongol*.”

That’s some pretty impressive secularism. Or maybe it’s some pretty impressive nationalism, of the sort that the rest of the world wouldn’t see until the 19th century. I’m no expert, but I can’t imagine anyone in Europe at the time identifying himself as first a Frenchman/Englishman/Tuscan/Spaniard/etc., and only second a Christian.

&#x200B;

3. Liberalism

In Scott Alexander’s [Reactionary Philosophy in an Enormous, Planet-Sized Nutshell](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/03/reactionary-philosophy-in-an-enormous-planet-sized-nutshell/), he describes the perfect government as one created by aliens which levies a 20% tax on the planet, but basically lets people do whatever they want so they can keep being productive. Genghis Khan’s government was basically a medieval version of this.

Yes, yes, everyone always talks about the death and destruction wrought by the Mongol armies. But here’s how their conquests typically happened -

A Mongol army would ride up to some big walled city and demand the unconditional surrender of the inhabitants. If the city acquiesced, the Mongol army would ride in, demand that their horses be fed, tell the inhabitants to hand over 15% of the city’s wealth, and execute the 100 richest guys (not counting religious figures whom they rarely touched). Then the Mongol general would tell the local city administration that they are now part of the Mongol Empire. Their duty is to report to this small group of (probably Chinese or Korean) bureaucrats that the army is going to leave behind.

Then the army would leave, because unlike almost every other army on earth at the time, the entirely-cavalry-based Mongol armies didn’t need to be supplied externally. In fact, it was easier to keep armies supplied out in grassy fields where their horses could graze than in the cramped cities where the 5-horses-to-every-one-man would quickly burn through the grain supply.

Then these Mongol Empire bureaucrats would inform the city of their new tax obligation to the Empire, which was nearly always *lower* than that of their old tax obligation to their previous empire. Also, religious freedom is now a thing, so anyone caught beating Jews or Yazidi Muslims better stop. And also, the Mongols have their own legal code with a *zero-tolerance policy*, which mostly consists of stuff like “don’t steal,” “don’t rape,” and “don’t murder.” Even the Golden Family (the close relatives of the Great Khan) and the Great Khan himself were subject to Mongol laws. For instance, no member of the Golden Family could murder another family member without achieving a proper quorum. Now that’s *rule of law.*

Oh sure, as a Mongol citizen you can steal, rape, and murder to your heart’s content, but only of *non-Mongol citizens*. If you’re within the Empire then *you’re one of us*, and you are afforded the Great Khan’s protection. As long as you don’t disobey the Khan’s law, you’re free to do whatever the hell you want.

**By medieval standards, this is a fantastic deal for a conquered people.** There were no forced religious conversions, no looting, no byzantine legal systems designed to entrench the conquerors as a privileged class, and lower taxes. Sure, the old ruling class will probably be wiped out, but Temujin quickly figured out that *the peasants don’t give a shit who rules them*. One haughty lord sitting in a castle is no different than any other one. So as long as the Mongols were fair and honest in their rule, these conquered societies didn’t mind being decapitated and absorbed.

You want more benefits of Mongol rule? How about *capitalism*? According to Weatherford, the Mongols created the largest free trade zone on earth along the Silk Road. With the assistance of a robust and honest legal system, never before had goods moved so easily from China to Europe, with key stops in the Middle East, the steppes, and India. Suddenly rich people around Eurasia could enjoy Persian silk, Chinese pottery, Indian spices, European jewelry, and all the bounties of two continents.

But that’s just the economic goods, what about *technological advances*? Remember, the Mongols were master meritocrats. They picked up the best and brightest in every place they conquered and took them with the army and administration as they kept conquering. The Mongols spread Korean paper, Chinese gunpowder, Chinese paper money, Muslim caravan techniques, and countless more technologies throughout Eurasia.

Better yet, the Mongols didn’t just spread *existing* technology, they facilitated the creation of new tech by forcing different cultures and experts together. They put Arab, Indian, and Chinese doctors together in the same hospitals, where they could argue and critique and improve each other’s methods. They revolutionized gunpowder, bringing it from an unwieldy rocket up to use in the form of a “handgun.” (I’m sure there are more examples, but I can’t remember them).

Basically, joining the Mongol Empire was *awesome*. It meant lower taxes, more economic growth, more tolerance, better law enforcement, more technology, and better technology. All the city had to give up was its old corrupt leaders, a cut of its present wealth, and its independence.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Costs**

Of course, if this walled city didn’t surrender to the Mongol army it would be brutally conquered. The Mongols might starve out the inhabitants or blow the walls down with Chinese engineering, and then enjoy no-holds-bar pillaging, raping, and looting for as long as they damn well pleased.

Just as peaceful Mongol occupation was remarkably *good* for the time, Mongol conquest was remarkably *bad*. Weatherford explains that the Mongols had no sense of military honor; they simply had nothing holding them back. They believed that the only measure of military value was in the plunder gained by victory. The Christians had chivalry to somewhat blunt excesses, and Muhammad laid out military conduct doctrines in the Koran for Muslims to follow (ie. one should only loot a city for three days), but the Mongols had no restraints. They took what they wanted, and if a city was outside the bounds of the Empire, its history, culture, and inhabitants held *no moral value* to the Mongol armies.

**As a result, the Mongol Empire killed something like 5-10% of the world’s population.**

[For instance,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_under_the_Mongol_Empire#Demographic_changes_in_war-torn_areas) the population of Persia may have dropped from 2.5 million to 250,000. Chinese censuses show a fall from 120 million to 60 million, though natural famines and diseases probably played a big role. Poor little Hungary may have lost one million out of two million during its Mongol invasion.

Of course, the numbers are hard to calculate. The best historians can do is look at the pre-conquest census figures in places that had them, and then look at the Mongol census usually taken almost a century later, and compare the two. There were contemporary estimates, but the Mongols had a habit of dramatically overestimating their kill-counts for propaganda purposes. But typically, it’s easy to see what parts of the empire fell more or less peacefully than others.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**How Genghis Khan Made the Modern World**

Genghis Khan made the modern world by establishing a sort of, kind of, vaguely secular liberal government to unify much of Eurasia under a fair and prosperous system, which facilitated trade, economic growth, and technological growth for centuries. This growth primed the birth of modernity in the place that most benefited from the Mongol Empire… Europe.

Europe got many of the benefits of the Mongol Empire at limited costs. China, India, Persia, and the Islamic Caliphate all benefited from Mongol rule, but only after having their populations and cities annihilated by the Mongol armies first. Despite being ahead of Europe culturally, economically, and technologically before the Mongols came, these regions were never able to recover, even with the full benefits of Mongol rule.

Europe was attacked by the Mongols too, but only in Russia and the East. The Mongols easily could have pressed to the Atlantic, and basically smashed all of Eastern European knighthood in a single easy battle, but through sheer luck the planned invasion of the continent was cancelled because the Great Khan died and all of his sons had to run back to Mongolia to try to replace him.

So European population loses to the Mongols were comparatively small, but Europe was still on the receiving end of much of the glorious benefits of Mongol rule. They may not have been subject to Mongol law, but they purchased goods produced throughout the Mongol empire, and snapped up the technology spread. It was this prosperity that both financed and inspired explorers like Marco Polo and Christopher Columbus to leave Europe and seek Mongol land on the other side of the world.

IMO this is where Weatherford gets really shaky. He doesn’t devote enough time or detail to explaining the causal connection between Mongol Eurasia and the birth of modernity in Europe, but if you squint hard enough, you can kind of, sort of, vaguely see it.",Mongol Apologia – How Genghis Khan Made the Modern World,agcl2b,new,53,202,202,0

**Preamble**

I've seen a lot of philosophers going after scientific ontology, and it all sounds so trite to me. I have such a polarized reaction to it - in that  I've never found any argument of this nature even the slightest bit convincing - as far as I can tell I'm too stupid/ignorant (no formal or informal philosophy education) to understand, or smart/knowledgeable (grad physics degree, so scientific ontology is kinda my deal). Now I get that people who are smarter than me totally buy this, but it seems like the vast majority of them are philosophers, and the vast majority of scientists (with a few notable exceptions) reject it. Sure, sure, the argument is that scientists are self-selected as well as incentivized to rejected these arguments - but philosophers are self-selected and incentivized to accept them.

Anyway, for fear of being falling on the stupid/ignorant side, I gave it another go here:

**Actual post content**

Science **can** count to red, goddammit.

It seems like this is yet another case of a thought experiment being constrained not to demonstrate a truth, but to compel a conclusion. So simply imagine the same thought experiment, with the following caveats:

1. The square doesn't just have a color, it has a hue, a saturation, and a translucency.
2. The colors have random values of hue, saturation, and translucency t*hat are relatively close the that of the previous square* (Relative to what proto-humans believed about the universe, that light has a constant speed in every reference frame isn't *that* different from what we believed about the universe in 1900; it's barely distinguishable, and yet it was a revolution).
3. There aren't 100 squares: we actually don't know how many there are, BUT...
4. There is a clearly discernible pattern in the squares we've filled in so far: though one or two of our three values regresses in a new step occasionally, all three of them have an unmistakable directional trend.

Boom. You have recovered ontological process. And, I argue, it's *obvious* that my ~~thought experiment~~ paradigm more closely resembles what we observe.

So, I like my paradigm better. It solves *every single puzzle* his paradigm solves *and more*. So now I'm disinterested in the paradigm set forth by the author, because the paradigm that better describes reality leads me to the conclusion that there is, in fact, scientific ontological process.

But this isn't the reason I've made this post. I've made this post because I'm so disappointed that the author's paradigm is so simple that I can think of a better one with very little effort. And I'm repeatedly surprised that the arguments I hear for the premise that there is no Objective Truth or that science doesn't make ontological progress are just so half-baked. They all have that literary criticism-feel to them, where they'r just guiding the reader to a conclusion, without ever really grappling with (or even acknowledging) the obvious fatal counter-arguments.

I mean, is it just me? Is there anyone here that has spent a lot of time doing a hard science that has been persuaded by these arguments *while also* maintaining a rejection of postmodernism and critical theory in general?",Science cannot count to read,agc002,new,41,3,3,0

(“For a mistake theorist, passion is inadequate or even suspect. Wrong people can be just as loud as right people, sometimes louder.

They’re not going to respond to your criticism by politely explaining why you’re incorrect. ….

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of January 14, 2019

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

There seems to be a tremendous focus on the question of whether god exists, and no treatment at all of whether believing in god is of structural benefit to society. The podcasters spend quite a bit of time on whether they should do more gatekeeping to keep religious people out of the rationalist community, without looking at all at the question of why they should be doing that, and what the adverse effects of it might be.

Looking at the thing through purely a Darwinist lens, it seems to me that two adjacent populations, which are identical in all respects except Pop(A) is deeply religious and Pop(B) is universally atheistic, that Pop(A) would outcompete Pop(B) in basically every respect.

* Pop(A) is likely going to make more babies, and making/rearing babies is the first obligation of a society biologically speaking.
* Pop(A) is going to be better at war, and by extension better at protecting its borders.
* Pop(A) is going to lose less sleep over existential issues such as the deaths of family members.
* Pop(B) has a higher chance of totalitarian government leadership erupting, since there is no higher power within (B) to appeal, and morality itself is controlled by the government. (we see this in China and the USSR)
* Pop(A) is less likely to have pervasive drug abuse.
* Pop(A) has an additional layer of behavioral indoctrination, wherein morals beneficial to the society can be installed.

I'm not deeply religious, but it seems to me that religion is a very positive structure, and the only real drawbacks it has in the modern frame are related to the fact that religions haven't had a recent update. When an atheist approaches me with the usual ""god doesn't exist"" bit, my natural inclination these days is simply to respond, ""presuming you're correct, *so what?""* Belief is a choice, and there are structural advantages to making that choice.

"[This article on excellence in swimmers](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-mundanity-of-excellence-an-ethnographic-report-on-stratification-and-olympic-swimmers) was recently posted [on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/afbb85/what_is_your_method_for_readingreceiving/edx510g). I was immediately enthralled and thought it deserved its own thread. In the article the sociologist Daniel F. Chambliss shares his findings on what makes some swimmers excel above others. Here is my summary of Chambliss' argument:

* Excellence does not result from quantitative changes, such as training more or swimming longer distances. Swimmers in higher levels are distinguished by their *qualitative* behaviour. They develop their stroke style, take care to make every movement perfectly, always come on time for practice, and so on. They find it meditative, even pleasant, to go through this difficult regimen.
* Different levels of the sport are discretely stratified. Athletes do not rise in the ranks by continuous improvement; they make discrete jumps into the next level. This usually happens when a new coach or new friends compel them to change their style, discipline, attitude, etc. Chambliss mentions that similar stratification is seen in other fields, such as academia: Writing a single article for a high-ranking journal is qualitatively different from writing many articles for minor journals.
* Quantitative differences play a role only within the same level of stratification. The swimmer who works harder will excel among his peers, but it won't take him to the next level. Coaches and observers overestimate the value of hard work because they only see the differences within their level.
* ""Talent"" as a catch-all word does not explain why some people achieve excellence. A multitude of factors, from social to geographical to biological, determine why some excel and others don't. People don't call swimmers ""talented"" until they have already achieved excellence. Innate advantages exist, but they are less important than sheer discipline and willingness to overcome adversity.
* Excellence in swimming results from dozens of small improvements that accumulate into large effects. Every time a swimmer perfects a tiny piece of technique their time improves slightly. The author argues that attention to detail is key in many other fields too, such as business, academia and maintaining friendships.
* Motivation is also maintained through small things. The daily pleasures of meeting friends, feeling strong and impressing the coach are important in keeping athletes motivated. Big goals like winning a medal in the Olympics must be translated into smaller goals to be effective. ""Small wins"" produce important results, including the willingness to work for another ""small win"".
* The main psychological challenge in the pursuit of excellence is ""maintaining mundanity"". Being able to regard major competitions as ""just another swim meet"" is important in maintaining composure. Chambliss mentions a student he knew in grad school, a very intelligent and hard working person. After seven years of work the student had still not finished his dissertation. He was unable to accept that a dissertation is something mundane, that it will never reach perfection and must eventually be turned in.

This argument matches my own experience: When I was studying languages at the undergraduate level, I was miles ahead of my classmates simply because I had the discipline to use an SRS every day. I put in less work than them and got more out of it.

I like the article almost too much, which is why I'm posting it here. The article very closely describes what I want to be true. Does it match your experiences?

Edit: Most commenters have jumped on the ""talent"" part of my summary. This is in my opinion the *least* interesting part of the article. The nature-nurture debate has been done to death.

"This is a tricky question to raise, and an even harder one to answer, but basically: if we re-ran the clock of human history, how might the order of technological progress be different? It seems like certain developments are very unlikely without others in place; it's hard to imagine a high-tech computer industry developing without mass production and modern machining techniques in place. But how likely would it be that electrification might precede steam, or modern telecommunications might come before flight? Were there any developments in human history where we can reasonably say ""we got lucky stumbling across that so early"", or ""it's amazing no-one put two and two together and made this technological leap in this whole period""?

"Not sure if this should be in a Wellness Wednesday comment or not...

I like to tell myself that I tend to read things that are valuable and high-quality. I'll usually read non-fiction books (in ebook or audiobook form) that focus on philosophy or history rather than fiction that is reading-for-entertainment. Most podcasts I listen to are long-form deep-dives on interesting topics (history, science metapolitical stuff) rather than the ""two guys wasting time weekly chatting about the news"" format. My RSS feeds are filled with an accumulation of ""interesting"" articles, the sort that get linked on SSC or Hacker News or gwern.

But I've come to the realization that I'm retaining very little of any of it. After reading something I'm at the level where some of the ideas have passively seeped into my brain, or I can decide if it's a recommendable work and to whom I should share it on Facebook, and in future conversations with friends/family some of the bits of ideas can arise, though it's not always clear to me exactly which book/article I found it in. I'm coming to the conclusion that despite all this stuff being interesting and insightful, it's still just entertainment to me: in one ear and out the other, just something to read/listen to to pass the time during the commute or at the gym.

One of the things I find so compelling and enviable about Scott's writing or gwern's posts or the various quirky blogs I stumble upon is that the writers are obviously good at being scholarly, that they can keep track of all the information and ideas they're receiving and can use it all to distill new abstractions and insights from it. This is a skillset I have obviously failed to pick up rigorously; my line of work is in computer science and so I've learned mostly to Google programming questions and quickly jump from page to page until I find information about my immediate problem and then implement it. 

At this point, this issue is actually getting in the way of even enjoying some books/articles/etc I want to read. For example, I  am wanting to go through Aristotle's works at some point, but without a method to actually pull out the relevant information and hold onto it in some way, I feel it would be a waste for me to even begin.

Basically, how do people around high-level communities like this one read, take notes, record relevant passages, and actually manage and work with all the materials out there? I know of spaced-repetition tools like Anki, but have never understood how it would be useful for something like this that isn't learning languages or medical anatomical terms or something.

In short, I feel I've reached a wall in terms of engaging with scholarly/insightful/interesting content, and have atrophied into being a social-media neuron who reads through works only to determine if it's worth passing along on my Facebook feed -- very surface level.

"Hi guys, this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm aware this topic is problematic but this is pretty much the only place I can think about where I can raise this kind of topic and get intelligent replies. I hope that the mods will choose to keep this.

I have been thinking a lot about life lately and reached to some disturbing conclusions. Basically, I can see only 3 good reasons to live:

1. External meaning - worship god, raise your kids help the poor etc...
2. Fun and joy - Just plain hedonism.
3. Fear of death and instinct

I've come to the conclusion that for me (And I would guess for many others) the only reason I'm alive is reason number 3.  For reason 1: I would say that kids are a reasonably good external meaning, all the rest seems somewhat ridiculous to me, I don't believe in god or religion - and it seems the end game of it all is heat death of the universe in the super long future or just human replacement by AI or another type of species very far from humans in the near future, and I don't see the point of bootstrapping it. But I don't want to have kids because it seems pointless and cruel (See reason 2).

Looking at the second reason: It just seems that life is full of suffering and that suffering is greater than pleasure for most people in most situations throughout history, I would admit that things are getting better and at least we kinda solved physical pain, but mental pain is still larger than joy for many people (I would even assume most) and myself included. Personally, I'm in a pretty good spot, I make good money (top 10%), I'm relatively young, healthy and fit - I don't have SO but I do get dates and sex from time to time, got supporting friends and family. I'm not heavily depressed or have anxiety attacks or mental illness, no drugs abuse. Objectively it seems I'm better than most. - but still, if I'm honest with myself, when things suck they suck much harder compared to how much good are things when they are good. My life consists of 40% neutral 30% somewhat happy 25% somewhat sad and 5% suffering and I would say that the net sum is still negative. And as I'm aging and I can only expect things to become worse. I suspect that many people who are objectively worse than me (people who suffer from serious mental illnesses, extreme poverty, inceldom or serious physical issues for example) will have similar or worse hedonistic math.

That leaves me with #3 as the true reason why I'm still alive, I don't suffer hard enough for me to be able to override instinct and fear of death. Which feels kinda dumb and not rational. In some paradoxical way, I think sometimes that maybe if I would fuck up my life on purpose by abusing drugs or something similar I will get to a point of suffering that might motivate me to really end my life and in some way the sum of hedonism in this situation will be higher than in a somewhat negative but long life: High Joy (Drugs abuse) + High suffering for a short time > Low suffering for a long time.

This conclusion makes me really dislike life and feel like I'm was Stockholm-syndromed into it. Am I missing something? Could you change my mind?

a few more notes regarding potential answers:

Please don't link me to suicide prevention hotlines, I'm not depressed and besides that, I read that they are shit anyway and people mainly link to them to feel better with themselves for ""helping"" when there is no real reason to believe they actually very effective and mainly serve as a way for people to cope internally and not really to help suicidal people which have shitty life (Sorry for this rant, I just really hate when people do this)

Another comment that I foresee is just ""You are clinically depressed, it sounds like that from your post - you just need to treat this"". No, I'm not, I've been to a mental health professional and he ruled it out (I really don't suffer from most of the symptoms). I would really appreciate if you'll answer my points on the factual level and not try to label me as mentally ill to discredit or devaluate my opinions.

Another potential comment: ""Just improve your life enough to have it positive sum"". I'm in my mid 30s and my life is so much better than it was in my 20s in terms of my needs being met and most other important parameters in life. And I am happier than I used to be, but it's still a net negative, I don't think my brain is optimized for me to be happy, it's optimized for survival. I'm naturally high on neuroticism - It would be foolish for me to assume that it's going to change in some magical way. It just doesn't seem it works this way.",Is living by itself rational?,aezq9d,new,133,13,13,0

"What I want to do is extract some not-exclusively-Christian ideas from Lewis that I think a mostly-non-theistic audience could still find useful and interesting.

I actually started work on this several years ago, and every few months would work on it a bit more before putting it aside. I’m still not quite sure I’m satisfied with it, but I figure I’ll go ahead and post it after being spurred by /u/Doglatine’s [Screwtape post](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/adxug8/advice_to_a_young_demon_concerning_the/).

------------------------------------

[Clive Staples Lewis](http://www.cslewis.com/us/about-cs-lewis/) was a British professor of English Literature at first Oxford then Cambridge. He is arguably the most influential Christian apologist of the 20th century, with his works like *Mere Christianity* and *The Problem of Pain,* explicating his theology. He also wrote fantasy and science-fiction literature with Christian themes, mostly famously The Chronicles of Narnia and *The Screwtape Letters.*

CS Lewis also had many notions that were really not necessarily connected to his Christian apologetics. There is some perversity in my post, admittedly—talking Lewis without talking about Christianity is something like the joke about the production of *Hamlet* without the character of Hamlet. Still, I think it is possible for a generally non-theist audience to appreciate some of the interesting not-necessarily-Christian things he had to say.


So I'm not going to talk [trilemmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%27s_trilemma) or [safe gods](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/81965-safe-said-mr-beaver-don-t-you-hear-what-mrs-beaver) or [pain megaphones](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/422142-we-can-ignore-even-pleasure-but-pain-insists-upon-being) or [“easy to please, hard to satisfy”](http://humanitas.org/?p=3567). I'm not going to talk [fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Novels_by_C._S._Lewis). I'm not going to talk about how Lewis was [not a biblical literalist](http://christopherbryanonline.com/articles/cs-lewis-and-the-bible/) and how his more conservative Evangelical fans may not realize how shockingly [inclusivist](http://www.theopedia.com/inclusivism) he was. There's plenty of places online you can talk about that. 


Instead, I’ll address a few scattered items throughout his work that I think might be of particular interest to you all.  (I may at some point do a second volume of these—I didn’t even touch on *The Screwtape Letters*, my favorite book of Lewis’, which is chockful of many rich insights.)







-----------------

**”[The Inner Ring](http://www.mit.edu/~hooman/ideas/the_inner_ring.htm)”** is a lecture Lewis gave about the desire to be at the heart of “the cool kids”:

>I believe that in all men's lives at certain periods, and in many men's lives at all periods between infancy and extreme old age, one of the most dominant elements is the desire to be inside the local Ring and the terror of being left outside.

Lewis argues that this impulse—the desire to be in the inner ring—is underappreciated for its lure and power:

>I don't believe that the economic motive and the erotic motive account for everything that goes on in what we moralists call the World. Even if you add Ambition I think the picture is still incomplete. The lust for the esoteric, the longing to be inside, take many forms which are not easily recognizable as Ambition. We hope, no doubt, for tangible profits from every Inner Ring we penetrate: power, money, liberty to break rules, avoidance of routine duties, evasion of discipline. But all these would not satisfy us if we did not get in addition the delicious sense of secret intimacy. [….] Unless you take measures to prevent it, this desire is going to be one of the chief motives of your life, from the first day on which you enter your profession until the day when you are too old to care. 

The craving for the Inner Ring can destroy you, but if you can resist it, the rewards are considerable:

>[…] you will be drawn in, if you are drawn in, not by desire for gain or ease, but simply because at that moment, when the cup was so near your lips, you cannot bear to be thrust back again into the cold outer world. It would be so terrible to see the other man's face-that genial, confidential, delightfully sophisticated face-turn suddenly cold and contemptuous, to know that you had been tried for the Inner Ring and rejected. [….] The quest of the Inner Ring will break your hearts unless you break it. But if you break it, a surprising result will follow. If in your working hours you make the work your end, you will presently find yourself all unawares inside the only circle in your profession that really matters. You will be one of the sound craftsmen, and other sound craftsmen will know it. This group of craftsmen will by no means coincide with the Inner Ring or the Important People or the People in the Know. It will not shape that professional policy or work up that professional influence which fights for the profession as a whole against the public: nor will it lead to those periodic scandals and crises which the Inner Ring produces. But it will do those things which that profession exists to do and will in the long run be responsible for all the respect which that profession in fact enjoys and which the speeches and advertisements cannot maintain. And if in your spare time you consort simply with the people you like, you will again find that you have come unawares to a real inside: that you are indeed snug and safe at the center of something which, seen from without, would look exactly like an Inner Ring. But the difference is that its secrecy is accidental, and its exclusiveness a by-product, and no one was led thither by the lure of the esoteric: for it is only four or five people who like one another meeting to do things that they like. This is friendship. Aristotle placed it among the virtues. It causes perhaps half of all the happiness in the world, and no Inner Ring can ever have it.

Lewis was fond of devising “tests” –proofs that will support whether or not a certain kind of relationship exists or a certain quality exists with one’s self. I will discuss three of them: 1\. How do you know if you are driven by hate for someone’s actions—or just hate for the person? 2\.How do you know if someone is truly a friend? 3\.How do you the true nature of one’s own character?

**The Enemy Test** (from [*Mere Christianity*](https://www.dacc.edu/assets/pdfs/PCM/merechristianitylewis.pdf)

The question is this: do you hate a person (which is, generally, bad) or hate the wicked things that a person has done (which is, generally, acceptable). The trouble is, both can *feel* very similar. So how can you tell?


As Lewis puts it:

>The real test is this. Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one's first feeling, ""Thank God, even they aren't quite so bad as that,"" or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker. If we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally, we shall insist on seeing everything—God and our friends and ourselves included—as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed forever in a universe of pure hatred.

Wishing that someone was *even more deplorable* than you had previously thought, then, is a sign of hatred: when we lament that we have one less justification for our animosity. 

Relatedly, picture hearing that someone is embroiled the worst possible scandal, the most calamitous news. Their reputation is in ruins; their life destroyed; every evil thing they’ve done has come home to roost and they are humiliated. THEN imagine a moment later that you’ve learned it is all false—none of it happened. This person is as happy today and they were yesterday.

Would you feel cheated? After all, why delight in the misery of an individual? But if you feel angry that this glee was plucked away from you—that your revelry in their pain is gone—then perhaps you are driven by hatred rather than justice.




**The Friendship Test** from [*The Four Loves*](https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/lewiscs-fourloves/lewiscs-fourloves-00-h.html)

How can one tell if a friendship is genuine or not?

In his small book *The Four Loves,* Lewis ruminates on four ancient Greek words for love. In his definitions, they are eros (romantic/lustful), storge (affectionate/family/pets), agape (love for love’s sake—God’s love), and philia (friendship). I always found the Philia section the most fascinating because he talks about friendship in a way that I have not encountered much elsewhere. (I was amused to find my feelings that the Philia section of the book is  the best one is reflected someone in [this collection of most-liked quotes from the book on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/14816053-the-four-loves); almost all the most popular quotes come from this same section.)

Philia is a not merely companionship with a work friend, or the deep connection with a spouse, or a drinking buddy: it is something deeply intimate. As Lewis writes:

>Friendship arises […] when two or more of the companions discover that they have in common some insight or interest or even taste which the others do not share and which, till that moment, each believed to be his own unique treasure (or burden). The typical expression of opening Friendship would be something like, ""What? You too? I thought I was the only one.” [….] That is why those pathetic people who simply ""want friends"" can never make any. The very condition of having Friends is that we should want something else besides Friends. Where the truthful answer to the question *Do you see the same truth*? would be ""I see nothing and I don't care about the truth; I only want a Friend"", no Friendship can arise--though Affection of course may. There would be nothing for the Friendship to be *about*; and Friendship must be about something, even if it were only an enthusiasm for dominoes or white mice. Those who have nothing can share nothing; those who are going nowhere can have no fellow-travellers.









So, back to the test, which I’ll break into three parts.  Friendship test 1: No matter how long you spend apart, when you come back with your friend, it is like no time has passed at all. You may have experienced meeting someone from a past association—a school friend or a work friend—and upon re-meeting them, realize that without the common, mutual experience that there’s nothing there anymore. A true friend, however, reconnects easily and instantly. 

Friendship test 2: no keeping of score of favors given or returned (“but I bought lunch last time!”). Quoting Lewis, with emphases added:

> Friendship is utterly free from [the] need to be needed. We are sorry that any gift or loan or night-watching should have been necessary--and now, for heaven's sake, let us forget all about it and go back to the things we really want to do or talk of together. Even gratitude is no enrichment to this love. The stereotyped ""Don't mention it"" here expresses what we really feel. *The mark of perfect Friendship is not that help will be given when the pinch comes (of course it will) but that, having been given, it makes no difference at all*. It was a distraction, an anomaly. 

Friendship test 3: Is not concerned with the social status or social circumstance of the friend.

>Friendship, unlike Eros, is uninquisitive. You become a man's Friend without knowing or caring whether he is married or single or how he earns his living. What have all these ""unconcerning things, matters of fact"" to do with the real question, *Do you see the same truth*? In a circle of true Friends each man is simply what he is: stands for nothing but himself. No one cares twopence about any one else's family, profession, class, income, race, or previous history. Of course you will get to know about most of these in the end. But casually. They will come out bit by bit, to furnish an illustration or an analogy, to serve as pegs for an anecdote; never for their own sake. That is the kingliness of Friendship. We meet like sovereign princes of independent states, abroad, on neutral ground, freed from our contexts. [….] At home, besides being Peter or Jane, we also bear a general character; husband or wife, brother or sister, chief, colleague or subordinate. Not among our Friends. It is an affair of disentangled, or stripped, minds. Eros will have naked bodies; Friendship naked personalities. Hence (if you will not misunderstand me) the exquisite arbitrariness and irresponsibility of this love. I have no duty to be anyone's Friend and no man in the world has a duty to be mine. No claims, no shadow of necessity. Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create). It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.



**True Character Test** from *Mere Christianity*:

>When I come to my evening prayers and try to reckon up the sins of the day, nine times out of ten the most obvious one is some sin against charity; I have sulked or snapped or sneered or snubbed or stormed. And the excuse that immediately springs to my mind is that the provocation was so sudden and so unexpected; I was caught off my guard, I had not time to collect myself. Now that may be an extenuating circumstance as regards those particular acts: they would obviously have been worse if they had been deliberate and premeditated. On the other hand, surely what a man does when he is taken off his guard is the best evidence for what sort of man he is? Surely what pops out before the man has time to put on a disguise is the truth? If there are rats in the cellar you are most likely to see them if you go in very suddenly. But the suddenness does not create the rats: it only prevents them from hiding. In the same way the suddenness of the provocation does not make me an ill-tempered man; it only shows me what an ill-tempered man I am.

The lesson is not that difficult to see nor certainly unique to Lewis—in short, how one reacts to an unexpected crisis reveals the truth of one’s character—but it is a sobering reflection I think about often. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Kindness vs Lovingness**

In [*The Problem of Pain*](http://www.samizdat.qc.ca/cosmos/philo/PDFs/ProblemofPain_CSL.pdf), Lewis explores the problem of theodicy: how would a good God allow for evil?

In the book, he briefly expands upon a distinction between two terms: *Kindness* and *Lovingness*. Lewis argues that when most of us speak of wanting a *loving* God when we are actually asking for is a *kind* God. Kindness is “The desire to see others than self happy; not happy in this way or in that, but just happy.” As Lewis notes, for most of us:

>What would really satisfy us would be a God who said of anything we happened to like doing, ‘What does it matter so long as they are contended?’ We want, in fact, not so much a Father in Heaven as a grandfather in heaven—a senile benevolence who, as they say, “liked to see young people enjoying themselves,’ and who’s plan for the universe was simply that it might be truly said at the end of each day, ‘a good time was had by all.”

Kindness, Lewis notes, when separated from Love, involves a kind of indifference or even contempt for the object. Kindness does not care “whether its object becomes good or bad, provided only that it escapes suffering.” We are content to let strangers lead their lives, but with those close to us we may rather see them suffer than live happy in contemptible lives. We wish the object’s good for the object’s sake. This is *Lovingness*.

I think about this kind/loving distinction often. I worry about the Dolores Umbridges of the world more often than the Voldemorts. I wish to be loving to my children; I wish my boss to be kind to me.  I have a dread of “loving” institutions or individuals that wish to shape us for our own good. As Lewis writes elsewhere:

> Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.




----------------------------------------------

This segues into my next part: **what are we to make of Lewis’ politics**? There are a couple of intriguing quotations from *Mere Christianity* that I’d like to include below:


>It is easy to think the State has a lot of different objects — military, political, economic and what not. But in a way things are much simpler than that. The State exists simply to promote and to protect the ordinary happiness of human beings in this life. A husband and wife chatting over a fire, a couple of friends having a game of darts in a pub, a man reading a book in his own room or digging in his own garden — that is what the State is there for. And unless they are helping to increase and prolong and protect such moments, all the laws, parliaments, armies, courts, police, economics, etc., are simply a waste of time.

And:

>Before leaving the question of divorce, I should like to distinguish two things which are very often confused. The Christian conception of marriage is one: the other is quite the different question-how far Christians, if they are voters or Members of Parliament, ought to try to force their views of marriage on the rest of the community by embodying them in the divorce laws. A great many people seem to think that if you are a Christian yourself you should try to make divorce difficult for every one. I do not think that. At least I know I should be very angry if [Muslims] tried to prevent the rest of us from drinking wine. My own view is that the Churches should frankly recognize that the majority of the British people are not Christian and, therefore, cannot be expected to live Christian lives. There ought to be two distinct kinds of marriage: one governed by the State with rules enforced on all citizens, the other governed by the church with rules enforced by her on her own members. The distinction ought to be quite sharp, so that a man knows which couples are married in a Christian sense and which are not.



I don’t think it is a stretch to see sort of pro-""hands off"" streak in Lewis—the government is best that let’s alone. It is also [possible to argue](https://duanegraham.wordpress.com/2012/03/18/why-c-s-lewis-was-right-about-government/) that Lewis would argue for a strong social safety net—one needed to “promote and protect” the happiness of individuals. 

----------------------------------------

I will finish with a longish book review and summary of CS Lewis' **An Experiment in Criticism.**

As idiosyncratic and varied as CS Lewis’ books are—literary treatises, fantasy, science-fiction, philosophy, personal accounts with sorrow and much more—perhaps the oddest little book is his [*An Experiment in Criticism*](https://www.fadedpage.com/showbook.php?pid=20140725), which talks in part about determining what a “good” book is. (He also has a very long digression early on upon the merits of fantastic fiction which is interesting in its own right, but my summary below was already so long that I decide to cut it.)

The interesting question that Lewis tackles is this: how do we determine what is a “good” or “worthwhile” work of art? How does one judge literature?

In *An Experiment in Criticism*, Lewis proposes: What if, instead of judging literature by its “usefulness,” we judge literature by the way people read it?


Lewis is not thinking of “Literature of knowledge” (science text-books, how-to works), which are primarily used to think more correctly and clearly on a subject. He is referring to “Literature of imagination,” which will be concerned less about altering our opinions, although this might be a side effect, than “with entering fully into the opinions, and therefore also the attitudes, feelings and total experiences, of other people.”

Lewis begins by differentiating between two types of readers: the Few, or the literary, and the Many, which is everyone else. The Few and the Many approach literature in different ways. If I were to summarize it, the Many utilize books as tools; the Few as cornerstones of their lives. 

So here are some of Lewis’ distinctions.

The Many never read anything twice. I recall my grandfather had shelves upon shelves of books by [Louis L’Amour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_L%27Amour). I once asked which was his favorite to re-read. He stared at me for a second and said he had never reread one of them. For my grandfather, each book was worth reading only once. 

The Many approach reading as a last resort. You read a book if there’s absolutely nothing better to do, in the same way you read the back of the cereal box as a kid. The Many do not allow themselves to be changed by a book. For Lewis, the Few would let a book profoundly move them, perhaps even change them. The literary (“Few”) reader may feel “I shall never escape this. This will never escape me. These images have struck roots far below the surface of my mind.” Likewise, The Many have not used books as a vital part of their thought system. The Few will quote books, or have thought-systems in their lives built from books. 

The Many view books for their “usefulness” only: what can I get out of it? Or, what is popular right now?  Even a scholar may view a book as only something to teach, or something to from which to publish an article. Or as a “good for you” exercise, such as lifting free weights when you’d rather be doing something else. 
Lewis writes, “*Using* is inferior to *reception* because art, if used rather than received, merely facilitates, brightens, relieves, or soothes our life, and does not add to it.” And elsewhere:


>The man who plays football for his health is a serious man: but no real footballer will call him a serious player. He is not whole-hearted about the game; doesn’t really care….Now the true reader reads ever work seriously in the sense that he reads it whole-heartedly, makes himself as receptive as he can.

So, The Many are also inured to pleasures of reading anything that is not straightforward narrative or practical. There’s no appreciate for sonorous, poetical writing, no consciousness of style, an impatience with anything that is not “events” (“what happens next?”) or off-topic the immediate explication of a plot. The Many prefer swift-moving narrative and prolonged mysteries: 

>Let us be quite clear that the unliterary are unliterary not because they enjoy stories in these ways, but because they enjoy them *in no other*. Not what they have but what they lack cuts them off from the fullness of literary experience[….]Those who seek only vicarious happiness in their reading are unliterary; but those who pretend that it can never be an ingredient in good reading are wrong.”

Lewis emphasizes that he is not saying there is something inherently inferior about the Many. One may be among the Many when it comes to music but one of the Few when it comes to Art. One may be an intelligent person of sophistication and be among the Few. One may have once been of the Many and then later of the Few, or vice versa. As well, Lewis writes: “the real way to mend a person’s taste is not to denigrate his present favorites but to teach him how to enjoy something better.”

So what is the point of literature? Hold on, Lewis is not there yet. Before delving into the positives, Lewis addresses the negatives.  Lewis talks about the ways in which literature should **not** function:

1\. Not simply for “truths about life.” Lewis rejects the notion that books are good primarily on the basis that they give us knowledge or teach us “truths” about “life.” Artists are too often “reverenced as teachers and insufficiently appreciated as artists.”
Lewis:

>Many of the ‘comments on life’ which people get out of Shakespeare could have been reached by very moderate talents without his assistance. For another, it may well impede future receptions of the work itself. We may go back to it chiefly to find further confirmation for our belief that it teaches this or that, rather than for a fresh immersion in what it is.

A determined critic, Lewis says, will find whatever he wants in a work: “We are so busy *doing things with the work* that we give it too little chance to *work on us.* Lewis rejects the notion that literature should be about teaching us “truths of life” or as an aid to culture and taste. Reception of the work is an end of itself. 

2\. Not simply for “relaxation” or entertainment.

The unliterary are not usually taken in by art. They know that a romantic subplot is added for appeal, or a silly action sequence is put in to titillate. They view art such as film as a place to relax, not to learn: “The idea that any of his opinions about the real world could be modified by what he saw there would seem to him to be preposterous.”

 Lewis takes pains, however, to note that something that entertains is not bad: indeed, the “entertainment” of literature is not the place where we dismiss it but the place where we *begin*. If a work cannot really entertain, we don’t have to pursue it any further. (This depends some on the reader, of course, Lewis notes: some could be bored by *Hamlet*.)


3\. Not simply to reveal “life as it is.” Lewis notes that some of his students would say that tragedy is the noblest of genres because it shows how the sufferer’s flaws cause tragedy or the splendor of mankind in tragedy. It shows “life as it truly is.” The claim that tragedy has “faced the worst” life has to offer, Lewis notes, is pretentious wish-fulfillment: “If tragedy is taken [to say] ‘This is the typical or usual, or ultimate, form of human misery’ then tragedy becomes wishful moonshine.” Lewis notes that the art-forms of tragedy do not often include the stupid, banal, or uninteresting, which is usually the nature of tragedy: 

>The tragedian dare not present the totality of suffering as it usually is in its uncouth mixture of agony with littleness, all of the indignities (save pity) the uninterestingness, of grief. He *selects* from the reality just what his art needs; and what it needs is the exceptional [.…] Next to a world in which there were no sorrows, we should like one where sorrows were always significant and sublime.

 Comedy is not an inferior form to tragedy, Lewis argues: both types of art are selective in what they choose to present. 

Artists themselves are not usually to blame, Lewis notes: this view is the creation of critics. Artists choose the matter to create satisfying drama, not usually choose the drama to illustrate the matter. 

*Lewis notes that genres will select details from life, not present all of it*:

a\. Tragedies leave out the littleness and smallness of life for the sake of dignity.

b\. Romances and “happily ever after” stories leave out the possibility of problematic futures for the sake of upbeat endings.  

c\. Farces leave out pity for the subjects for the sake of humor. 

Lewis:
>None of these three make a comment about “life in general.” They are all constructions: things made out of the stuff of real life; additions to life rather than comments on it. “


Next, literature should not act simply as vehicles for philosophy or worldview. 

Art works poorly as a mean to communicate philosophy. Rather, we learn insights and reflections colored through the artist’s perspective. But even this can be taken too far. Literature is not merely a mere vehicle for truth—this is still viewing literature as *something to be used* rather than *something to receive*. This means that even if we disagree with the artist’s world view we can still enjoy them:

>A true lover of literature should be in one way like an honest examiner, who is prepared to give the highest marks to the telling, appropriate and well-documented exposition of the views he dissents from or even abominates.

Finally, literature should not simply as something to analyze or deconstruct. 

Critical reading: where we pick it apart and analyze it only to deconstruct it: “Thus we fail of that inner silence, that emptying out of ourselves, by which we ought to make room for the total reception of the work.”

Lewis disliked encouraging students to be critical or suspicious of all works—“the very same habit which makes them impervious to the bad writing may make them impervious to good…we must risk being ‘taken in’ if we are to get anything. The best safeguard against bad literature is full experience of good; just as real and affectionate acquaintance with honest people gives a better protection against rogues than a habitual distrust of everyone.” Lewis notes that every piece should complement each other as part of a grand design. Each piece is valuable for itself and for its role in the totality of the work. The biography of the author or the history of the piece is only important if there is a piece to begin with. 

Thus, we start slowly coming back to our question. Lewis avoids a formalized theory or full description with his answer, choosing rather to give the framework for his thoughts. Lewis says we tend to divide books into three categories: those beyond the pale and those within the circle of accepted reading. In that circle we divide it further with “the best” and the “rest.” What if we were to switch this categorizing from books to readers?

Lewis (finally!) gives us a definition:

**Good literature is that which permits, invites, or even compels good reading**. 


What, according to Lewis, is the benefit of this kind of definition?

*It fixes our attention on the act of reading*. Whatever the value of literature is, it is actual only when and where good readers are present.


*It prevents us from falling to the waves of fashion*. Good readers will recognize good literature. A good place to start, Lewis says, is the established canon: we can assume that generations of literary readers were able to winnow out the good literature through many years of reading. 


*Critical condemnation would be much more difficult*.  “If we find that a book is usually read in one way, still more if we never find that is read in the other, we have a case for thinking it bad. But if we find even one reader for whom the book was a lifelong delight, who had read and reread it, who would notice, and object, if a single word were changed, then, however little we could see in it ourselves and however it was despised by our friends and colleagues, we should not dare put it beyond the pale.”

Thus:

>Always, there may be something in it that we do not see. The probability that anything which has ever been truly loved by any reader has some virtue in it is overwhelming. To condemn such a book is therefore, on my system, a very serious matter. Our condemnation is never quite final. The question would always without absurdity be re-opened.

If find this broad-minded and charitable as a reading—generously allowing that a book beloved by someone may have some quality that we missed. 

So then Lewis flips the question: What, then, is a “bad” book? Simply, a book that does not permit or invite good reading. A bad book does not elicit bad readings but rather *fails to elicit good readings*. We must ask: does this book deserve and reward alert and disciplined reading? When all, or most, of a writer’s proponents betray unliterary, or anti-literary, or extra-literary motives for their penchant, we shall have just suspicions of the book.  Yet, we should not read a book for the purposes of condemning it: “We can find a book bad only be reading it as if it might, after all, be very good. We must empty our minds and lay ourselves open.”

We can pronounce a work good because we, as literary readers, have found something positive within it. The work is on those who want to insist it is bad. The great art of criticism is to get oneself out of the way and to let humanity decide. A literary reader will be easy to please but hard to satisfy: “We do not need critics to enjoy the authors, but we need authors to enjoy the critics.”

Finally: Why pursue great literature and endeavor to become a literary (“The Few”) reader?

1\. We are not complete within just ourselves. “The necessary condition of all good reading is to get ourselves out of the way,” Lewis writes. 

Why is it worth listening to what anyone says? Lewis retorts: “Unless you contain in yourself sources that supply all the information, entertainment, advice, rebuke and merriment you want, the answer is obvious. And if it is worth listening or reading at all, it is often worth doing so attentively. Indeed we must attend even to discover that something is not worth attention.” 

2\. There is a great and unique pleasure and good to be derived from a great work of art. “The experience [of a great book] could not give this pleasure unless it were good for us; not good as a means to some end beyond the [work], but good for us here and now. The relaxation, the slight (agreeable) weariness, the banishment of our fidgets at the close of a great work all proclaim that is had done us good.” 

Lewis stands against “all those who would find the value of literary works in views or philosophies of life, or even comments on it. [I] place goodness in what has happened to us while we read; not in some remote or merely probable consequences.”

3\. None of us can accept the created worlds of fiction whole-heartedly. None of us can agree with all the worldviews of every author. Why pursue great art, then? 

Lewis argues it is to gratify our rational curiosity about other people’s psychology, not in the sense of “knowing” but in the sense of living it. It admits us into experiences other than our own:

>The nearest I have yet got to an answer is that we seek an enlargement of our being. We want to be more than ourselves. Each of us by nature sees the whole world form one point of view with a perspective and selectiveness peculiar to himself. And even when we build disinterested fantasy, that are saturated with, and limited by, our own psychology[….] We want to see with other eyes, to imagine with other imaginations, to feel with other hearts, as well as with our own [….] We demand windows [….] One of the things we feel after reading a great work is ‘I have got out.’ Or from another point of view, ‘I have got in’; pierced the shell of some other [worldview] and discover what it is like inside.

Good reading, therefore, though its value is not essentially an emotional or moral or intellectual activity, has something in common with all three:

 >In love we escape from our self in one another. In the moral sphere, every act of justice or charity involves putting ourselves in the other persons’ place and thus transcending our own competitive particularity. In coming to understand anything we are rejecting the facts as they are for us in favor of the facts as they are. The primary impulse of each is to maintain and aggrandize one’s self. The secondary impulse is to go out of the self, to correct its provincialism and heal its loneliness. In love, in virtue, in the pursuit of knowledge, and in the reception of the arts, we are doing this. Obviously this process can be described either as an enlargement or as a temporary annihilation of the self. But that is an old paradox: “he that loseth his life shall save it.
	
And:

>Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors. We realize it when we talk with an unliterary friend.” He lives in a tiny world: “the man who is content to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me; I will see through those of others. [….] Admittedly, we can never quite get out of our own skins. Whatever we do, something of our own age’s making will remain in our experience of all literature. Equally, I can never see anything exactly from the point of view even of those whom I know and love best. But I can make at least some progress towards it. I can eliminate at least the grosser illusions of perspective. Literature helps me to do it with live people, and live people help me do it with literature.”


4\.  Literary experience heals the wound, without undermining the privilege, of individuality: “In reading great literature I become a thousand men yet remain myself […] Here, as in worship, in love, in moral action, and in knowing, I transcend myself; and am never more myself than when I do.”

- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

"A puzzle: undefeated boxer [Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr.) has had two post-retirement fights against MMA stars making boxing debuts, and each fight played out utterly differently. The first, against [Conor McGregor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_McGregor), seemed [reasonably competitive](https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-scorecard.jpg?w=640) before Mayweather won a stoppage in the tenth round. His more recent bout, against [Tenshin Nasukawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenshin_Nasukawa), was [utterly lopsided](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6RNWKqgM3k) and Mayweather won a first round corner stoppage. Both McGregor and Nasukawa are successful young stars in MMA who were making boxing debuts. Why were the two outcomes so different: is it or is not the case that an MMA fighter can be competitive against a pro-boxer? There must be some shenigans going on somewhere, but which way around is it?

Did Nasukawa throw the fight against Mayweather? Certainly, this has been [widely alleged](https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/rizin-ff/brendan-schaub-argues-floyd-mayweather-vs-tenshin-nasukawa-fight-was-fixed/).

Or did Mayweather carry McGregor to simulate a competitive fight and allow for a lucrative rematch? Some pro boxers have [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EorLFgFpBDw) this to be the case, and Mayweather doesn't necessarily [disagree](https://www.mmamania.com/2017/12/4/16736304/floyd-mayweather-carried-conor-mcgregor-through-their-fight).

I had gambled on Mayweather stopping McGregor in the first round, as I predicted then that MMA skills wouldn't trasfer to boxing and he'd be soundly beaten. So I was surprised when it didn't happen the first time and then confused when it did the second time! Rather frustrated, too, that I can't just Google my way to the truth of this matter. So, can rationalist insights shed any light on this?",Making sense of Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s post-retirement fights,adzngl,new,39,28,28,0
"My dear Wormwood,

Your last missive robbed me of any residual trace of hope I might otherwise have had for the education of your generation of tempters. For once again, you have matters quite backward, fearing the most promising of signs in your patient and gloating over those you should regard as worrisome. And while Our Father Below approves of perversity in conduct, he forswears it entirely in the matter of judgment.

You say that your patient has become acquainted with the set known as “the Rationalists”. You gloat that his incipient atheism may become firmly fixed via this affiliation, yet fear that a dedication to truth and reason may lead him away from our influence. And you give little thought as to the more subtle sway this new set may have on his moral character.

Let us begin by deflating your hope that this new circle will secure his atheism and alienate him forever from the Enemy. As you are well aware, your patient was well on the way to godlessness – for that is the true mirror image of religion – well before you got your clutches on him. The fellow gave not the slightest thought to matters immaterial, and had not set foot in a church since his tender years. This is precisely the state in which it is desirable for us to keep a human: not believing, yet not making the slightest effort to find arguments for their non-belief.

Yet now, via this new acquaintance, he will find among his fellows many who are not merely godless but *enthusiastic* atheists. These rotten characters will spend hours upon hours genuinely *reflecting* on the arguments human philosophers have given for the Enemy’s existence. And while many of them will remain unmoved by these, there is always a risk some virulent particle of metaphysics will slip through. What if your man begins questioning the nature of consciousness, or the self, or the apparent contradictions in the everyday notion of time? Any of these lines of uncertainty could lead him dangerously close to the Enemy’s territory.

As for your fear that his new appreciation for truth and rationality somehow threatens our ultimate possession of his soul – this is similarly misguided, (what do they teach young tempters at school these days?). He may, to be sure, come to recognise a few of the worst habits of the human mind, but he is still a creature of flesh and blood, and can scarce avoid them entirely.

You are, of course, correct in asserting that falsehood and ignorance are not among the tools of the Enemy; His very nature is anathema to them. But it would be a mistake to therefore assume that Truth is always against us. As one of the human philosophers has noted, Truth is a many-faceted jewel, that shines now this way and now that in the light of reason. Even we cannot gaze upon it in its entirety, while mortals do well to catch even the most fleeting glimpse of it. Yet – absurd though it may seem to us – with a little prodding, they can be made to think they have seen a good deal of it; perhaps even all of it! From there, it is a short step to make them dismiss all opinions of others as founded upon Ignorance and Stupidity. And once thus snared, they are ours.

Indeed, there are even some particularly corrosive Truths to which you should, if possible, actively direct him. Social psychology might be a good place to start. There he will find ample evidence for the ultimately wicked nature of the human soul – its willingness to harm others in the name of authority, its eagerness to divide *us* from *them*, its apathy towards suffering. His new acquaintance with Rationality will make it hard for him to reject this evidence out of hand. But rather than engender humility or gratitude for the generally beneficent state of human civilization, it will lead him to an unconscious pride. No man believes himself truly wicked, and thus by convincing him of the wickedness of human beings, you serve to make him think that he alone is somehow immune to these moral failings that dog the rest of mankind.

If the opportunity arises, you might also direct him to the field the humans call psychometrics. I believe he has been educated in the Liberal Arts thus far. He will therefore believe that notions like IQ and intelligence are mere stuff and nonsense (he will called them ‘discredited’; our Department of Philology is to be congratulated for that invention). Yet if you can drive him to delve a little deeper into the matter, he might find some hard kernels of truth that, though initially uncomfortable for him, may soon flower into delightful blossoms of self-aggrandisement and contempt for his fellow men. Try though he might to recall the words of the Paul that there is “neither Jew nor Greek, nor man nor woman, but all are one in Jesus”, I have found such notions of moral and spiritual equality prove flimsy in the face of ‘bell curves’ and ‘fluid g’.

As to his moral character more broadly – first, let me assuage any worries you might have that he will become one of those so-called ‘Effective Altruists’. Very few mortals truly have the stomach for it, and even among those that do, one may often discern hidden motives that provide us with material to work with. I will grant that there are a few foul beacons of light among them who are truly willing to devote their lives to the betterment of others. But such exemplars are rare, and – if I may be blunt – far beyond your ability as a corrupter. That you have made any headway with your patient thus far suggests that he is not such a man.

No, this new affiliation will likely work to our benefit. Foster his pride, his conceit, and his swelling sense of self-worth at his association with the Rationalists; kindle the first sparks of scorn for his former friends, and let him lament what he sees as their inability to weave cogent arguments or avoid quite elementary fallacies. With a little luck, he will soon despair of having meaningful or productive conversations with anyone not versed in the concepts and patois of his new-found tribe, robbing him of the kind of spontaneous human connection so congenial to the Enemy.

Still, do not let him avoid discussion entirely: direct conflict is vital for our attempts to ensnare him. But you should ensure that as many of his interactions as possible occur remotely, without the moderating influence of personal proximity. As for the subject matter, channel him towards politics and economics if you can. Let him pick a side and fulminate or sneer about intersectionality, virtue-signalling, social justice warriors, cis-privilege or whatever other fashions of the day seem most apt to goad him. Every knot of cultural grievance he threads is binding him further to us.

"Both Oxford and Cambridge require their undergraduates to go to one-on-one tutorials, called supervisions in Cambridge. Students generally must go once or twice a week. depending in their subject.

Cambridge strategies writes;

""Although the supervision itself has tantalisingly unquantifiable values,  this labour-intensive method of teaching seems to have contributed  strongly to keeping both Cambridge and Oxford in the top five of  worldwide university rankings. Different Oxbridge colleges vary but, on  average, most students have two supervisions a week that last roughly  for an hour ""

For arts subjects, students are required to submit original work weekly which will then be read and discussed in the tutorial.

I've personally heard from English friends that this brings a whole other element of pressure to college work, especially in first year. However, this system has proven extremely effective. Richard Dawkins credits his success to what he learned being tutored. For example,  Joseph Stiglitz was tutored Joan Robinson, who had another student who went on to win a Nobel prize in economics.

"Question: Is pork belly a zero-extra-suffering food? There's so much pork production already, one would imagine that pork belly comes from pigs who are already being eaten. Same question applies to any unusual animal part, like eating bone marrow, chicken feet, or cow tongue.

In 5 minutes of googling, the evidence I find is:

\- Bacon also comes from the belly of the pig, so that may bork my original guess ([https://tableagent.com/article/pork-belly-fab-or-fad/](https://tableagent.com/article/pork-belly-fab-or-fad/))

\- All the charts I can find compare pork vs. beef etc, but not types of pork consumption. Anyone know a good source for this?

I'm interested in others' take on this, or since bacon may ruin my guess, on similar cases like cow tongue.

"I was getting bombarded by articles about new years eve resolution to eat less meat specifically for carbon footprint reasons. It does not make sense to me. I posted this exact question on Ask Science a few days ago but recieved no response. So I am trying here - maybe somebody can point me to a good source? The actual text I posted on Ask Science follows:

*I am really having a hard time finding good sources on the topic. On one level, if thinking about it logically the medium-term carbon footprint should be approximately zero. Whatever biological material such as grain or grass is consumed needs to grow back next year to sustain the supply of beef therefore reabsorbing the CO2 from the atmosphere back. Whatever methane is produced and released will be reassembled back in the digestive tract of the cow born next year.*

*I have hard time seeing carbon footprint in human or natural activities that do not directly involve digging carbon from the ground and then burning or otherwise releasing it into atmosphere thus increasing its concentration.*

*There may be things I do not know about methane cycle or maybe carbon footprint of associated activities like heating cowsheds or carbon footprint of grain transportation etc. Anyway, I'd love to know what is going on here.*",Why does beef have such a large carbon footprint?,adj4o6,new,62,18,18,0

Can we have a movie about how humanity meets aliens and *not* have it be about the personal lives of the particular people who meet them?

> I don’t want to use such a douchey expression but since you’re an imaginary straw-person you won’t mind: *check your goddamn privilege.* You think personal drama is an essential part of stories (and therefore that stories without it are deficient) because it is to you, it is to most people, and the majority of stories try to appeal to those sensibilities — Serious Literature especially. You’re used to getting your way all the time; personal drama has to be frickin’ everywhere.

&#x200B;

> I get the feeling sci-fi stories, no matter how grounded, have to add some emotional pain to be taken seriously. Portraying negative emotions makes art serious and deep, because positivity is childish and superficial. I dislike this implied artistic hierarchy because *I don’t think that’s true at all* Instead I suspect we find negative feelings ”deeper” precisely because they are not — they push some very obvious and powerful buttons. It’s easier to tell ”deep” (emotionally resonant) stories about sad and terrible things because its easier to evoke strong negative feelings than strong positive ones. What makes you miserable is more obvious, more powerful and more universal, while what makes you happy is elusive and personal

> I hear Louise’s personal story is better centered (and not pasted on) in the original novela. Sure, it might be, but it still feels like a bad fit to me. Maybe I just don’t think that it’s a good idea to combine the personal and the ”cosmic” scales in a single story. It requires us to shift frames which makes the story feel disjointed. Grand scale narratives engage other parts of the mind than intimate, personal ones and tying them together is like mixing ketchup and lettuce.

My 2 Cents: This phenomenon is due to a difference in mental architectures.

Quoting an earlier comment of mine from SSC:

&#x200B;

  

>Writers, especially non-science fiction writers, tend to be highly neurotypical and people-oriented. Even the writers on Star Trek famously had to leave the technobabble to actual sperges.  
>  
>It stands to reason that the chrome-and-circuits fanboys would be completely alien to the average writer. An exception would be hard sci-fi, where the characters inadvertently come off as robotic due to the aspergic writer being more interested in ship schematics than people.  
>  
>This difference between mental architecture sets up an amusing situation best seen on the new Battlestar Galactica:  
>  
>TV and film writers are highly people-oriented, with the ones on sci-fi shows often coming from non sci-fi backgrounds and only begrudgingly taking the job. This leads to them using as the sci-fi setting as only a background to what they really care about, character-focus and relationship drama. This in turn, drives away sci-fi fans (or the male ones, at least) who tuned in for advanced technology and exploration of the unknown, not extreme emotional angst.  
>  
>These two cognitive types, empathizers (average writer), and systemizers (average sci-fi fan) can’t really reconcile their interests.

>Again, best place to see this play out is in the new Battlestar Galactica, but also the Abrams Star Trek reboots.

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of January 07, 2019

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/slatestarcodex's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.

"Hi Guys

So, in a pro-choice world that had strict child-support laws, is it fair for the female to be the only one with the choice regarding the abortion?

If the male wants the child and the female doesn't, then the child will be aborted. If the female wants the child and the male doesn't, the male doesn't seem to have an option and the child will be born and the male will be forced to pay child support?

Is this an unfair outcome? In the first case (female doesnt want), there is the argument that the female has to place a huge burden on her body.

However, in the second case, doesn't the man place a huge burden on himself since he'll pay for the child for the next 18 years?

It seems like a fair rule would be that the woman can decide whether or not to have an abortion, but if the man wants an abortion and the child is born then he doesn't have to pay child support?

However, this creates a problem where men have the incentive of always wanting an abortion (therefore, if the child is born and they change their mind, they can start being more involved with the child. But they're never forced to pay child support).

The counter-argument I've seen to that point is *the man shouldn't have had unprotected sex then*, but doesn't that same argument apply to the scenario where the woman doesn't want the baby and the man does (the woman shouldn't have had unprotected sex then)? 


Am I getting the arguments right? What's the most fair way to resolve this?

**TL DR** - Right now, I'm inclined towards thinking the man has just as large a responsibility a woman does in a child's life. A woman must go through pregnancy & childbirth but the man has to financially support the baby until he turns 18. Therefore, a man should have just as much say as a woman does in terms of the abortion. However, this seems to create a bad incentive?",Question regarding Abortion?,adafnc,new,147,8,8,0

"One of the truthiest one-liners I know: “[Almost no one is evil. Almost everything is broken.](https://blog.jaibot.com/)” Almost any time I get the inside view of a system, so much seems broken or just barely holding together that it startles me the whole still gives the appearance of functionality and works for the people within it.

In my time as a student, for example, everything seemed bizarrely inefficient and full of contradictory goals, and my returns to the education system have only reinforced that impression. As a religious missionary, I was amazed at just how dysfunctional missions and the faith felt at times, with missionaries sometimes going months or even their full two years having hardly taught anybody, and with the great majority of those who did convert disappearing with a few weeks or months. The medical system writargr is an archetypal example, of course, as is national politics.

But naming broken-feeling systems is easy. I’m curious about the ones that *aren’t* that way: things that just work, without fanfare or complaint, that noncontroversially have positive effects. There’s some danger to listing examples here, since every time you mention thinking something works you risk being exposed to a horrifying hidden world by a flood of commentary poised to identify its failure states. Having acknowledged that risk, I was inspired to ask this by a recent visit to the optometrist. It was, oddly, a pleasure. Their machines unambiguously, precisely test my eyesight. The process is fast and painless. I get accurate prescriptions, and it’s not unreasonably priced. Something that would have been a devastating obstacle to success in ancient times is now reduced to a minor inconvenience and fashion statement.

National parks come to mind as well—I can’t say much about challenges with funding or upkeep, but the base idea to set remarkable areas aside as protected, then encourage both tourism and conservation, seems to have had great positive effects with few attendant issues.

"It's getting better as the Huawei incident moves to the backburner but there was a point where it was impossible to have a good conversation with anyone about the incident on Reddit because as soon as you argued anything that could be construed as pro-China, you were accused of being a Chinese Communist Party shill.

**The economics of it don't make sense**.

Being fluent in English at a high enough level to debate politics with someone else on Reddit while pretending to be their countrymen is an exceedingly rare trait in China. Consider that 1) India's English proficiency is leaps and bounds ahead of China's and 2) When speaking to an Indian English speaker, you can quickly tell that they are not North American, what chance do Chinese internet trolls have? The only people in China who speak English at that level have been educated in top international schools or studied abroad for years. These people are too busy or too highly paid for them to take a job shilling for the Chinese government on Reddit.

Think of how dreadful the ROI on this project would be. The Chinese government paying someone at least 40,000 USD a year to argue with people on Reddit. 

**But isn't it a proven fact that the Chinese government pays people to post pro-China comments? Aren't they called wumaos?**

Yes and yes. But crucially these people post in Chinese on Chinese websites for Chinese people. This is a pretty low paying job that only people without better prospects would take. None of these people speak English. You have never encountered a wumao on Reddit.

**But isn't Russia doing this?**

Russian is using bots. They hit and run. They post something polarizing on an open platform like Twitter or Facebook, signal boost with other bots then watch the chaos. They are not engaging with anyone on a personal level, like a Reddit comment thread. 

**If there are no Chinese government shills, why are there so many strongly pro-China opinions?**

This one is easy. Chinese people are very nationalistic. Many Chinese-Americans/Canadians/Australians still strongly identify with China and have both the knowledge and inclination to argue with people online. These people are simply arguing their own deeply held beliefs as opposed to a shill who argues what they are paid to argue.

"Edit: I want to state for the record at the top that I'm not a doctor and this isn't medical advice and that fasting can be extremely dangerous.

*I'm sorry for writing this how I have: I couldn't get any words down properly. It's hard because I have no expertise and formal writing feels like posturing for spurious authority, but I hope with the below the general idea gets across at least.*

&#x200B;

I came across [this Journal of Orthomolecular Psychiatry article](http://www.orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1974/pdf/1974-v03n04-p301.pdf) (PDF) [here](https://cristivlad.com/the-five-stages-of-fasting-dr-nikolayev-russian-case-studies/), after seeing [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1b08X-GvRs) on fasting. The first third of the documentary was about fasting in Russia. A psychiatrist there, Yuri Nikolaev, allowed fasting for a patient who didn't want to eat and the patient ""returned to society"" (presumably) soon after fasting. The psychiatrist then began to treat other patients with long fasts, with some success. In Soviet Russia, patient improves treatment. The other doctors were nonplussed, but then they ran trials and fasting became a thing in Russia.

&#x200B;

(The topic came up on Twitter and an American psychiatrist, Chris Palmer, said, [""Interestingly, most of these patients DID relapse.  But they got better while in ketosis. The Russians didn’t know about keeping them in ketosis after the fast.""](https://twitter.com/ChrisPalmerMD/status/1073547976398782465). One of the Russian doctors in the documentary said they didn't understand exactly what was happening in fasting with ""sanogenesis"", although they were able to, for example, see the disappearance of histamine in lungs over the course of a fast.)

&#x200B;

Valter Longo (who's featured in the last third of the youtube video) has investigated fasting for a couple of decades now and he says that periodic fasting of cycles of about five days can regenerate the immune system. I saw [this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/29/opinion/sunday/schizophrenia-psychiatric-disorders-immune-system.html) which suggested that the immune system could be involved in (some) schizophrenia. I thought, ""Oh, maybe you don't need the 25-30 days to treat schizophrenia that's amenable to fasting and you could just do repeated cycles of Dr Longo's Fasting-Mimicking Diet because apparently the 'regeneration' carries over between cycles?""

&#x200B;

But it might not just be the immune system, because prolonged fasting (>3 days) affects every cell, apparently, and [my cerebral palsy got better](https://www.reddit.com/r/CerebralPalsy/comments/765v65/the_fasting_mimicking_diet_has_helped_my_cerebral/) and mice with brain issues, too, so.

&#x200B;

I don't know how medication would be addressed, as things can interact with fasting and that can be really dangerous, besides possibly interfering with the effects of the fasting. Obviously, any fast would have to take place under medical supervision, but spaced FMDs might be less onerous/more practicable.

&#x200B;

I just thought it's interesting!

"[Double bind Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind)

[The ""Be Spontaneous"" Paradox](https://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/avoid_be_spontaneous_paradoxes.html)

As far as I can tell, these topics haven't been discussed much in the Rationalsphere, which I find surprising. They are responsible for a significant amount of interpersonal conflict and decision-making problems. I would assume virtually everyone has found themselves in double-bind situations, though they may not name them as such.

In short, a double-bind is a situation where a subject must deal with contradictory demands at different levels of communication, and cannot evade making a decision. The contradiction itself makes it impossible to satisfy both demands, while the split in communication makes it difficult to recognize or elucidate the contradiction as such.

I'm not sure if the command to ""be spontaneous!"" is considered a double-bind all on its own, or if it's a related phenomena. Either way, it is a really fascinating and clear example, because the declaration itself is the very thing that prevents its own fulfillment. Once it is declared, whatever the recipient does afterward cannot be considered ""spontaneous,"" because the command has already preceded (and thus influenced) their behavior.

Here are some other toy examples I could think of:

* ""I order you to disobey!""
* ""Do it because you want to, not because I told you.""
* ""Teenagers are supposed to rebel.""
* ""Be more assertive!""
* ""Be yourself!""

"(apologies in advance if this is not that well-structured: I have a few points I want to make but am not sure how best to connect them)

I'm trying to come up with solutions for living with the fact that my memory, just like the rest of humanity, is fallible and easily influenced by the conditions *when* I remember something.  However, I've noticed that my recollection of events is much more highly editorialized these days than back when I'd tell stories about myself in college.  I have no idea if I'm making up and polishing more details these days or if I'm simply more aware of the fact that our memories are highly suggestible.

One thing that was certain was that I was a fairly committed fabulist when I was a child.  Some of it was typical childhood stuff, such as blaming a broken poster on a sibling or imaginary friend.  There was also a lot of false travel stories I'd tell my classmates to seem more impressive.  Since this was before the days when people would compulsively photograph everything (even in well-off neighborhoods), a lack of photographic evidence was not a showstopper.  I'd tell stories from my grandfather's trip to Alaska as my trip there, for example, and maybe mix in something from my dad's trip to Portland as well.

Looking back, the cause there is fairly obvious: make myself sound more impressive in a status-obsessed school district of the late '90s.  My perspective in elementary school would be the ""poorest family in the rich district"", a.k.a. solidly upper middle-class surrounded by those who were either more well-off or of similar or slightly lower income to my parents but fiscally irresponsible and into conspicuous consumption.  Since my parents did not buy us electronic toys, I read lots of books to fill my time and told made-up summer travel stories to sound more impressive to my classmates.

Between middle school and the end of college, I do not remember making things up like I did in elementary school, mostly due to changing cultural norms among my classmates that made what you owned less dominant over what you can do academically (which was something I was genuinely good at).  I'd estimate I was most honest to others about my life story during my second half of college and first two years after graduation.

However, I've noticed that my personal stories have gotten highly editorialized in the past few years.  It's not that they're entirely fabricated like when I was in elementary school but rather that minor details get added or exaggerated to fit other narratives.  If I were the protagonist for a first-person novel, I would have been a deceptive narrator in elementary school and an unreliable narrator now.  This is probably for two primary reasons:

1. Time has erased minor details from my memory, so my brain fills in details as I tell the story and those details just happen to support whatever point I'm trying to make with that story.  Since telling a story reinforces it, those details become baked-in as real  memories without basis from actual events.  Sometimes I can catch these if I reflect on them later (such as saying spur-of-the-moment in response to a job interview question that you like being the point person in an emergency when that is really not the case: it was a combination of that I enjoyed the satisfaction of accomplishment once I resolved the issue and the desire to please my interviewer)
2. Being way too online means I often deliberately alter details and omit key points to prevent having a coherent narrative to my online presence to prevent doxxing (and I do prefer the internet when everyone's stories are treated as illustrative fiction rather than an internet with expectations of direct correlation to offline life).

The effects of all this is that it has left me with a case of impostor syndrome where I'm constantly worried that I'll get caught without proof of my less-tangible accomplishments, such as music I haven't finished or small programming projects from years ago that I didn't think to save.  The security mantra of ""trust no one"" taken too seriously is not healthy for your mental health once you stop trusting yourself.  It's not like I have a deliberately-constructed series of lies made for a specific purposes with pre-planned answers to likely follow-up questions, so any clarification that asks for a point that I had unwittingly made up is a constant fear of mine.

I suspect that the primary factor that allowed me to be honest during college was that I was already accepted in a group of friends with great mutual trust.  It simply didn't matter what I said (within reason—I'm sure they would have given me the boot if I were a rapist or in the KKK), they'd still be my friends, so I could be honest with them.  I got by in middle and high school and my first year at college by simply not telling anyone anything.  Can't be dishonest if you never say a word.  This also did earn me a reputation for having no personality as a freshman in college, since I was too obvious about steering the topic of conversation away from myself.

The reasons for my relapse into editorialized stories after college are that I've either been online (with its attendant alteration of details to establish myself as unreliable to protect privacy) or been in people-pleasing mode IRL (either job-hunting or making new friends—it's very hard to spend enough time with people you meet after college to reach deep friendship in a reasonable time: I'm still fairly closed off with people I've known for 2+ years, while I was opening up by the end of my sophomore year in college).  The other thing I've noticed is that my online presence has unintentionally become *more* honest as the narratives I tell others IRL gently slide toward fiction: I think that my prior honesty with my life story when told IRL made it easier to identify and alter superfluous details online, but once things got muddled IRL, it's no longer feasible to maintain a clean separation between the deliberately altered stories I tell online and the misremembered/embellished stories I tell IRL.

"Wellness Wednesday thread for January 02, 2019

The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives. It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and if you should feel free to post content which could go here in it's own thread. You could post:

- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

It doesn’t matter what moral system you use, because all moral systems were trained on the same set of Mediocristani data and give mostly the same results in this area. Stealing from the poor is bad. Donating to charity is good. A lot of what we mean when we say a moral system sounds plausible is that it best fits our Mediocristani data that we all agree upon. This is a lot like what we mean when we say that “quality of life”, “positive emotions”, and “meaningfulness” are all decent definitions of happiness; they all fit the training data. The further we go toward the tails, the more extreme the divergences become. Utilitarianism agrees that we should give to charity and shouldn’t steal from the poor, because Utility, but take it far enough to the tails and we should tile the universe with rats on heroin. Religious morality agrees that we should give to charity and shouldn’t steal from the poor, because God, but take it far enough to the tails and we should spend all our time in giant cubes made of semiprecious stones singing songs of praise. Deontology agrees that we should give to charity and shouldn’t steal from the poor, because Rules, but take it far enough to the tails and we all have to be libertarians.""*

"I’ve written a couple of book summaries on here over the past few months, and this one for *Hillbilly Elegy* will be the most difficult. J.D. Vance’s autobiography is a sociological summary of Appalachian American culture, and by extension the culture of poverty across America, which uses his own life as a case study. The book is basically a series of linked anecdotes with only occasional introspections thrown in, so I’ll try my best to lay out Vance’s story, and integrate his claims and arguments.

(Note – I listened on audiobook, so my quotes are approximations of real quotes in the book.)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Introduction**

In one of his posts which I’ve since forgotten, Scott Alexander argues that there are three essential explanations for long-term poverty in the Western world – external (either extreme misfortune or oppression), cultural (bad ideas encourage self-destructive behavior), and genetic (HBD). If I had to put Vance’s evaluation into this paradigm, I would say he attributes Appalachian poverty to 10% external, 15% genetic, and 75% cultural.

You know that classic Republican straw man about poor people? It goes something like –

**“In the glorious modern American capitalist economy, all people can pick themselves up by their bootstraps and make a good living if they really want to. The only way to fail is to not try hard enough. Poor people are all lazy loafers who would rather take drugs, rack up illegitimate children, and become welfare queens, than work an honest day in their lives. It’s their own damn fault they’re poor.”**

Vance argues that this straw man is basically true.

Yes, of course it’s more complicated than that. There are external factors at play that makes the lives of his fellow hillbillies in Appalachia worse, like the collapse of American industrialism. But underlying the depressed economies, high unemployment, underfunded schools, and shoddy welfare networks, are simply a lot of bad decisions made on an individual level.

Early in the book, Vance points to his former co-worker, Bob, as a typical example. Out of high school, Vance worked at a tile company, which offered full-time, heavy physical work for $13 per hour to start plus benefits, and up to $16 per hour with seniority, which was excellent work for the region and depressed economy at the time. Yet Vance’s boss consistently had trouble finding workers. Eventually he found Bob, a 19 year old high school drop out with a 17 year old pregnant girlfriend. The boss was nice enough to not only hire Bob, but offer his girlfriend a secretary job.

Bob missed at least two days of work per week, and his girlfriend would miss three. Both never gave notice, and when they did show up they were usually late. Bob would also take 3-5 bathroom breaks per day which were so long that Vance started a game where he would count the minutes out loud each time, usually going up to 30-40.

Eventually the boss got fed up, and fired both Bob and his girlfriend. Bob responded by nearly physically assaulting the boss, and screaming at him in the warehouse, asking the boss, “how could you do this to me!? I have a pregnant girlfriend! How are we supposed to survive!?”

Everyone gets married young. Women constantly have children without committed men. Men beat and cheat on their partners. Women stay with their abusive partners, at least until the men get bored and leave. Everyone eats junk food and drinks soda for every meal. Everyone screams all the time, or they punch each other. People buy stuff they can’t afford. Everyone heavily drinks. Drug abuse is everywhere, especially of prescription painkillers. Few people want to work, and those who do are terrible employees. Yet nothing is ever anyone’s fault. Or rather, every bad thing is the fault of the economy, the government, Obama, the industrial companies, the Japanese, the Chinese, or some other mysterious malevolent force somewhere in the universe.

Vance goes at lengths to argue that the current economic and sociological analyses of what’s wrong with these communities get a lot right, but they’re always missing a certain something. They can trace the causal lines between employment or income and stable families or grades, or whatever, but past a certain level of analysis, the prime causal factor exists in a murky haze that even he can’t quite articulate. It’s some combination of bad cultural memes, laziness, malaise, and a detached locus of control. At one point late in the book, Vance says that if there was one thing he wished he could change about hillbilly culture, it’s “the feeling that our choices don’t matter.”

Only a very select few hillbillies “make it” in the sense of achieving a stable, middle-class lifestyle. J.D. Vance is one of those few. He starts off the book saying that he feels ridiculous writing a memoir because his “greatest accomplishment” to date was graduating from Yale Law School. Yet, as he walks the reader through his life, it becomes more and more apparent just how amazing that feat is.

**Vance’s Story**

I won’t go through Vance’s entire family history and life, but here’s the (lengthy) TLDR:

Vance’s family has deep roots in northern Kentucky, making them pure “Borderers” in the *Albion’s Seed* sense. In the mid-20th-century, Vance’s mother’s parents (“Mamaw” and “Papaw” as he calls them, key figures in his life) moved from Jackson, Kentucky, to Middletown, Ohio, a booming industrial town based around Armco Steel, along with thousands of other ambitious Appalachians. Mamaw was impregnated when she was 13 while Papaw was engaged to another woman, but nonetheless, they achieved a surprisingly successful middle-class life with Papaw working in the steel mill and Mamaw taking care of five kids. They came from nothing and achieved prosperity, so they assumed their kids would continue on the same trajectory… but then the American industrial economy went into decline.

The smartest hillbillies cashed out or moved to the coasts for professional work, but the rest stayed behind. So Vance’s mother grew up in a crumbling industrial façade. Due to some combination of decent parenting and raw ability, many of Vance’s aunts and uncles became surprisingly successfully as they moved out of Middleton and set up businesses elsewhere. But Vance's mother was the black sheep of the family. Though she was considered the smartest of the bunch, she followed in her own mother’s footsteps, and was impregnated straight out of high school without the fortune of the father staying around. Five years later, she had a second child, J.D. Vance, and his father didn’t stick around either.

Vance was born in 1984 right as Middletown plummeted into an industrial hellscape. What used to be a charming factory town with a Normal Rockwell-esque main street and benevolent corporate benefactor, became infested with drugs, crimes, and most alarmingly to Papaw, the Japanese, who bought out Armco (though Papaw later admitted the Japanese were alright, and China was the real threat). The town itself is just as much a part of the story as Vance, but I’ll focus on him for now.

Vance’s childhood faced a constant struggle between the stabilizing forces of his grandparents (just Mamaw and Papaw, the other two are rarely mentioned) and the chaos of his mother. Vance directly attributes his own successes and failures as an individual throughout his childhood, to which side had more influence on him during any one point in his life.

First there were his grandparents. Mamaw sounds like a fake movie character, but somehow that’s what makes her seem so real. Every time Vance quotes her, “fucking” inevitably shows up in the sentence. Like, “I’ll fucking kill you,” “stop being so fucking lazy,” or “if you’re thinking about putting me in a retirement home, you better take my magnum and put a fucking bullet in my head” (she was not kidding on the last one). She was considered the “toughest, meanest” woman in town, yet she was a constant source of love and support for Vance. Mamaw encouraged his best habits, always gave him a place to stay when his mother was out of control, and was the only real example of a reliable adult in his entire life.

Papaw is a bit less important because he died when Vance was in middle school, but he was also a stabilizing figure. He was a sort of stereotypically good hillbilly who liked fixing cars and never verbally admitted to a mistake, but would always buy gifts for Vance if he lost his temper and gave him some fatherly support. One time, a pharmacy clerk scolded Vance for playing with an expensive toy in his store, so Mamaw began smashing things on the ground, and Papaw told the clerk that he would “break his fucking neck” if he talked to his grandson again.

Papaw and Mamaw didn’t live together when Vance was alive because they had fought with each other non-stop for thirty years. But once they moved to separate homes, there was a reconciliation, and they spent nearly all day, every day together. Somehow they put behind them the fact that Papaw had been such a dire alcoholic, that Mamaw had once poured gasoline over him while he slept, and set him on fire (he miraculously made it to the hospital with only minor burns).

Papaw and Mamaw’s other children also occasionally show up, and despite being rough sorts, they were Vance’s early role models. One was a prolific pot grower, one had moved to California, and the others owned businesses. They were typical “fun uncles” who saw Vance when he visited Kentucky and did lots of outdoors stuff. They also told Vance fun stories, like the time one of his uncles almost beat a man to death for calling him a “son of a bitch” twice. Appalachian men take their mothers very seriously, and the beaten man didn’t press charges.

Vance’s mother (I’ll just call her “Mom”) was a train wreck. We’re never given a precise diagnosis, but I wouldn’t be surprised if she was bipolar and borderline, plus has a strong genetic tendency to addiction. She posses a lot of the worst stereotypes of hillbilly women – unreliable, self-destructive, over-spender, lazy, bounced between men, drug addict, etc.

The one area where Mom thankfully didn’t fall into the stereotype was her choice in men. Surprisingly, none of the five longer-term boyfriends/husbands in Vance’s young life were abusive (they were far more likely to be abused by Mom). In fact, Vance liked each one of them for different reasons. His birth father had a troubled youth but reformed as a quiet middle-class pastor (albeit a young earth creationist afraid of Magic cards), and eventually re-entered Vance’s life. Vance’s last name was taken from Mom’s first husband, a (literally) toothless hillbilly stereotype who was nonetheless kind to Vance in elementary school. Then there was a cop who often took Vance fishing, followed by a firefighter who Vance thought was the epitome of cool, and finally a mild-mannered dentist who was one of the few examples of adults Vance ever knew who didn’t yell at his wife.

The problem was that none of these men were ever around for more than a few years. Those five were all in Vance’s life for brief stretches from Vance’s kindergarten to his sophomore year of high school. Although the men were nice, Vance learned not to form any real bonds with them, and he barely bothered remembering the names of his dozen-plus step-siblings. Vance treated them all like guests in a hotel. To Vance, the sheer intransigence of it all was the very worst part of his childhood.

For example, Vance moved from Middletown to another city 45 minutes away with his mom when she wanted to live with the firefighter. He left behind his school, local friends, and the comfort of his grandparents living next door. Six months went by of non-stop fighting between Mom and firefighter and Vance assumed it would end any second. But one day, Mom came home and told Vance she was getting married. Vance was surprised and noted out loud that she was constantly fighting, and he wondered if it was a good idea. Mom replied that she was actually marrying her boss, whom she had started dating a month ago. Also, they were moving in with him next week.

And so they did. Vance moved into a house with a new step-father and two new step-siblings he had never met before. Less than a year later, Mom got divorced and they moved out.

But that was just the men… Mom’s problems ran far deeper. Due to the aforementioned mental problems and drugs, she became increasingly unhinged over time, and downright psychotic.

The most harrowing scene in the book describes when Vance was maybe six years old and riding in the car with his mom. A minor argument escalated to Mom gunning the car to 100mph and screaming, “I’m going to crash the car and kill us both.” Vance jumped in the back seat, figuring that he could use multiple seat belts to protect himself. Mom began desperately trying to hit her son, until she got fed up and stopped the car on the side of the road. Vance jumped out, ran across an empty field to a house and screamed at the lady sitting in her pool, “my mom is trying to kill me!” The lady ran in the house with Vance, called the cops, and barricaded the door while Mom tried to smash her way in. Eventually Mom succeeded and dragged Vance out of the house, but the cops showed up just in time and arrested her.

You may have noticed that the book is filled with insane anecdotes like this.

A turning point for Vance was when as a freshman in high school, his mom barged into his room one day and demanded a clean urine sample. At first, Vance was scared, because he had smoked pot recently, but then he remembered to be angry because his mom had absolutely sworn that she would never touch drugs again. But apparently the years of rehab, group therapy sessions, and Narcotics Anonymous meetings hadn’t worked. She was still popping pain pills, and her parole officer would bust her if she didn’t get clean urine by the end of the day. Her own mother was on too many medications to work, so she resorted to her teenage son.

Not long after this day, Mamaw stepped in and demanded that Vance live with her. From about his sophomore year of high school onward, Vance lived alone with Mamaw while his sister got married and had a kid after high school, but miraculously with a good guy whom she lived with. It was during this period that Vance’s life started to turn around. He lost weight, made reliable friends, stopped experimenting with drugs, got a part-time job at a grocery store, grades skyrocketed, he aced the SATs, he graduated from high school, he went to Ohio State University, and he got put on the life trajectory that eventually landed him at Yale Law School.

The period of Vance’s life after high school reads like a 19th century account of a native from one of the dark continents moving to London or Paris and becoming civilized.

Though Vance’s grandma put him on the right track, the biggest turning point was joining the Marines out of high school. The way Vance describes it, the Marines acted like a crash course in middle-class culture. It gave him a reliable authority, enforced discipline, and showed him that he had underestimated his own control over his life. But more than that, his boss literally made him shop around for bank accounts rather than choose the shitty local bank, and forced him to buy a Honda instead of a BMW, and forced him to not take a shitty loan, and made him eat real food instead of soda and cinnamon buns for breakfast. The 13 weeks of bootcamp made Vance a new person, and his description of how his life turned around feels very Jordan Peterson-esque, especially when he describes the beaming pride of giving Mimaw $300 per month for medication – the first time he had supported her instead of vice versa.

After the Marines, Vance went to college at The Ohio State University, and graduated in two years while working multiple jobs on the side. Then he jumped to Yale Law School, cavorted with the elite, married an Indian woman in his class, and ended up in the solid middle-class life he always dreamed of.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Analysis**

The point of Vance telling his story, and the point of me writing it all out here, is that his story isn’t unique (at least up until he joined the Marines). According to Vance, *most* people he knew growing up had similar lives.

Vance attributes his own success to having a bunch of variables fortunately go the right way for him. Despite his mother’s madness, she instilled in him a work ethic and emphasis on education. His grandparents, sister, and a key aunt acted as reliable support figures, and even the revolving door of men were kind while they were present in Vance’s life. (IMO Vance downplays the importance of his own natural abilities, as his family was full of relatively successful people, and even his mother was a high school salutatorian.) Yet in nearly all of his neighbor’s lives, these variables didn’t fall into place.

But it’s so tough to see how many variables need to line up for even one person to “make it.” Vance consistently stresses that by raw material standards, nobody in Middletown was doing *that badly*. Yet they were miserable, depressed, addicted, and hopeless anyway.

For instance, when Mom was with her first husband, the toothless hillbilly guy, they could be considered solidly middle-class. Mom was a nurse, her husband was a truck driver, and together they made over $100K per year with two kids in a low-cost-of-living region of America.

And yet financial problems were always one of the biggest triggers of family screaming matches. They were deeply in debt because both Mom and the husband bought multiple new cars per year, they ate out every day instead of cooking, and they purchased a below-ground swimming pool. The house was already mortgaged, but was falling into disrepair due to lack of upkeep, while they repeatedly crashed new cars, and burned through meager savings with credit card fees.

Vance’s family *could* have been fine. His parents could have lived comfortably, had good savings, and started a college fund. And maybe if they did, the stress wouldn’t have driven Mom and husband to break up, and Mom wouldn’t have turned to drugs, etc. But it didn’t turn out that way.

Throughout the book, I had a question that I wished Vance would have answered directly. **Are hillbilly values the problem, or hypocrisy against these values?**

The Middletown residents in Vance’s childhood were very proud of their town’s history. They were one of the few American counties to fill their WW2 draft quota with volunteers, and the Armco plant had produced wonderful steel for American-made cars for decades. They were a fierce and proud people.

But Vance points to an HBO documentary about Appalachia where the patriarch of a massive family opines for minutes about “women’s work” that he won’t do. Yet he never addresses what “men’s work” is, which seems more pertinent since despite being a senior citizen, he had never worked a day in his life.

Vance’s neighbor growing up was an obese woman whose favorite pastime was sitting on her porch and railing against Democrats and their stupid welfare systems which the poor greedily leeched off of. Meanwhile, she had multiple kids from different fathers and had lived off of welfare since the day she left high school. When pressed, she argued that she was one of the few people who deserved a little help, while most welfare users were abusive parasites.

Hillbillies love to talk about Jesus and the role of god in their lives. In surveys, they report going to church more than any other population group in the country except Mormons. Yet, when researchers actually look at church attendance records, they find that Appalachian rates rival those of California and New York. Everyone talks about the value of church, but nobody goes to church.

Papaw always said that the measure of a man was how he treated the women in his family. Mamaw encouraged Vance to beat up any boys who insulted his mother and his sister, and she gave Vance a big “atta boy” when he got his ass kicked while trying to fight a guy who dumped his sister, despite the guy being three years older. Vance never got in trouble for these fights because everyone in his town understood the honor code. Yet Papaw cheated on his first fiancé, probably cheated on Mamaw, and was an alcoholic piece of shit towards her for decades. Infidelity and spousal abuse was borderline universal, and screaming matches between spouses was just a way of life.

Speaking of yelling, everyone yells. Vance’s parents yell, his neighbors yell, his teachers yell, everyone yells. Vance remembers opening the windows on either side of his house to catch the details of nightly shouting matches coming from his neighbors. Vance reports literally not knowing any adults who didn’t yell save for one of Mom’s husbands. One of the biggest “civilizing moments” for adult Vance was when his wife sat him down and explained that anytime they had a disagreement, Vance would either go berserk and scream at her, or literally walk away for hours at a time. Vance had never learned another way to communicate with loved ones.

I was aware of all these stereotypes before reading the book, but seeing them so fully fleshed out really brought home how scary it is. These people probably aren’t evil… but a lot of them are kind of bad. Or at least foolish. Or at least make really stupid decisions all the time. Somehow, that’s even scarier than being evil, or at least it’s harder to fix.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Solutions?**

Vance argues that there is no solution to hillbilly culture. The best we can do is try to tip the scales to push a few marginal cases in the right direction.

Vance has an interestingly ambivalent attitude towards government welfare. Basically, it does some good, and a lot of bad, but it's mostly a neutral force. His family was occasionally supported by parts of the welfare state and he was thankful for that, but he also knew plenty of welfare queens who never even attempted to get a job. While working at a grocery store, Vance regularly saw people use their food stamps to buy soda, sell it outside the store at a loss, then come back in and buy cigarettes and alcohol. He distinctly remembers seeing welfare users talk on their cellphones at the store, while Vance, as a working student, could never afford one.

Likewise, Vance is uncharacteristically optimistic about the public school system. Despite his local school being ranked as one of the worst in the state, he reported always having good, caring teachers, and blames the rankings entirely on the students and their parents. Realistically, no amount of money will get unmotivated students from unstable homes to make an effort at school. Throwing more money at these schools is a waste.

Vance is even skeptical of small-scale charities. Near the end of the book, Vance recalls participating in a charity program where he was supposed to buy toys for local underprivileged children. But using what he remembered from his childhood, he vetoed toy after toy, as he guessed which ones would be stolen or piss off an angry stepfather, or otherwise end up being useless. Vance concluded that the charity itself was just as pointless as the toys he was buying.

So what does work?

Mentorship is one option. Vance attributes much of his success to the positive influence of a handful of family members, and now he tries to do the same for a few teenagers in similar environments. It’s especially useful to give these kids a jump start on the *civilizing* process, with simple tips like “wear a suit to a job interview” or “don’t curse in front of your boss.”

Religion can also be useful. Hillbillies tend to live hopeless, chaotic lives, and the church can act as an anchor to bring order and stability. Plus, the church can lend direct monetary and social assistance to those in need. The problem is that hillbillies don’t actually attend church, so they end up being about as useful as schools.

Beyond that… Vance is quite grim about the prospect of changing hillbilly culture. He hopes there will be a subtle shift over time with the right forces pushing from within and without, but he fears that the worst elements will always linger in some form.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Addendum**

As a final note, I want to throw in a bit of skepticism about Vance’s credibility.

While reading the book, he came off as entirely earnest and honest to me, but when I checked his Wikipedia afterward, I felt a slight twinge of skepticism. I mean, it’s probably nothing… but within months of the book’s release, Vance got hired by a Peter Thiel-owned venture capital fund, then became a contributor at CNN, then opened his own Ohio-based non-profit, and is now publicly considering a Senate run as a Republican.

Once I read his Wiki, it dawned on me just how *clean* Vance comes off in his own story. In a tale packed with alcoholics, drug addicts, and philanderers, in a rough part of the country, Vance seems a little too good. He mentions occasionally underage drinking, and smoking pot a handful of times, but no hard drugs. He never once mentions women until he reaches his adulthood in the story. He yells at his eventual wife, but it's excused by his bad upbringing. Maybe I’m being cynical, but I wouldn’t be too surprised if Vance left out some details just in case he ran for office one day.

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of December 31, 2018

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

" Has anyone here read anything by Mark Z. Danielewski? I really, really enjoyed House of Leaves, but then something terrible happened: he wrote The Familiar, Volumes 1 through infinity. This man has made an extraordinary, Olympics-worthy dive into a very deep pool of *his own ass*. The Familiar is like reading a crossword puzzle for people with autism. 

 The story starts on pg.50. Everything before this can accurately and literally be described as a fever dream by a transcended spirit person watching youtube videos. I maybe got to pg.100. 

 The Globe and Mail reviewer says,

 >For his new book, The Familiar, Volume 1: One Rainy Day in May, that angle of entry comes from an interview excerpted on the publisher's webpage for the book. After setting out the mammoth undertaking – One Rainy Day in May is the first in a projected 27-book-long series, with subsequent volumes to be released every three months or so – Danielewski describes the book as a continuation of his refraction of other narrative forms through his fiction: ""If House of Leaves tackles the movie, Only Revolutions music and The Fifty Year Sword the campfire story, then The Familiar will show how the novel can stalk, take down and devour the television series.""

 >Understanding One Rainy Day in May as something akin to a television program is crucial to reframing one's expectations for the book; the first volume of the series doesn't work, strictly speaking, as a novel, and reading it with those traditional expectations is an exercise in frustration. Reading it, however, as one approaches the pilot to a new TV series, volume one becomes a revelation, a thrilling, compulsive reading experience.

 Vice's reviewer seems to agree with me a little more and writes, 

 >For starters, I'm not sure what The Familiar is about, a remark I find amusing coming out of my mouth, being the kind of reader who usually loathes tropes like plot, character, setting, epiphany, meaning. But where in other hands the presence of ambiguity can be exciting, in Danielewski, it just seems flat. Often the book relies on its typography to carry forward what otherwise remains undeveloped, switching modes just in time to get away from actually having to get somewhere beyond its pace. Instead of reinforcing the momentum with equally provocative language—or even, more simply, compelling writing—it is merely the bang and flash of the production that fuels the motor.

 When I said I really, really enjoyed House of Leaves, I meant it. By ""really, really enjoyed"" I mean I tell people it's my favorite book. I also tend to like other cryptic-y books with unusual typography (Tree of Codes, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close). But this... *this*.

 Did anyone else who may have read it have a different experience with The Familiar? Or maybe hated House of Leaves?

"Almost all commentary on this issue uses *advertised tuition*, which ignores how much students actually pay due to financial aid. Once you try to measure *what students actually pay*, the trend is largely flat. 

Evidence:  look at this chart

https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2018/03/26/contrary-to-what-everyone-thinks-college-costs-less-these-days/#7e5308fd18ff

Also, look at this nifty little tool to see how tuition scales with income: 

https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/09/30/444446022/what-youll-actually-pay-at-1-550-colleges

As the default graph that appears when you open this link indicates, Amherst is actually more affordable for students with family incomes <110k compared to Ohio State, contrary to what you'd expect going by advertised tuition. 

Finally, just think about the incentives schools face and you should immediately reach the conclusion that advertised tuition numbers mean little. Imagine you are running Harvard. If you want to maximize tuition revenue, your optimal policy is probably to charge a tuition of around ten million usd per year, which will be payable in full only by children of Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and the like, and everyone else gets a ""need-based scholarship"" which leaves the final bill equal to what you think they will actually agree to pay. This is more or less what happens -- that Ivy League schools go with an advertised tuition 40-80k as opposed to ten million  is a function of social norms (i.e., the desire to avoid appearing to be a club for millionaires).

**Update:** Looking over the responses after leaving this overnight: your personal anecdotes are not a counterpoint to national statistics. I'm sorry that you didn't get a good scholarship. That, however, doesn't change the data on how much college costs to the average students. It sucks that you have friends with six figure debt and few means to repay it, but are those people representative of the average? That's what you need statistics for. 

Here is [a chart that goes back to 1970](https://i2.wp.com/www.econlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/https___www_newyorkfed_org_medialibrary_media_research_current_issues_ci20-3_pdf-3.png?resize=351%2C389). Looking at net price, it tells a more nuanced story about the cost of a bachelor's degree that I haven't seen before:

* A big fall in the cost of a college education from 1970 to 1975.

"Hi boys! The most hated girl here. I wanted to post on here to stop the civil war before it begins. I see the discussions and PMs you guys send me and I want you to stop. 

First, I want to clear up a few things. I am not an autistic man pretending to be a woman. Yes I am a woman! Please stop accusing me of having a penis. Thanks! Second, I am not some super genius trying to mess with you I promise. I spent most of my time on Tumblr until recently. I only got into reddit fairly recently after the great Tumblr purge. I only messed with you guys because I drank too much wine one night. That was the only time I ever bothered you guys I promise! Cue all the white woman jokes that I see you guys have posted and about my entitled attitude. Third, I promise I won't mess with you guys anymore. All I ask is that you guys stop going through my post history about the breakup in there and sending me stuff telling me I'm crazy and neurotic. Maybe it's true but the 8th message with the same thing isn't going to change my mind. Also, the messages telling me I'm a huge slut don't help either.

So to summarize all of this. I am not a man. Please stop messing with sneer club because they didn't do any of this it was just me and only me. And please stop messaging me that I am a stupid white slut. I promise I won't mess with any of your subreddits and LW websites again. Can we all agree on this? Thanks boys!

"A lot of the time I see people describing aphantasia, the inability to see images in the mind's eye, it sounds to me like they have unrealistic expectations of what visualization is like. They assume that because they do not have constant photorealistic visual impressions of the world in their head they must be unable to visualize; yet if you ask them to pick up a pencil and draw you a picture of a dragon they'll attempt it without any problem. Obviously they're pulling such images from somewhere. This would mean that their problem is not lacking the ability to visualize, but misunderstanding what visualization is capable of.

The alternate hypothesis, though, is that I have aphantasia or unusually weak mental imagery myself, but have unusually low standards for what mental visualization should be able to do for me. Intuitively, this feels like a stupid gotcha, but I'm struggling to figure out how to rule it out.

Of course, it's also possible that aphantasia is real, but heavily overdiagnosed by self diagnoses. I've got nothing against this possibility, except that it's difficult for me to imagine what it would mean for someone to lack mental imagery so thoroughly and would appreciate good descriptions to bridge this empathy gap.","Is Aphantasia Real, Exaggerated, or a Misunderstanding?",ab1fi4,new,33,21,21,0

"Im teaching a group of students who are religiously unaffiliated in a subject that replaces religion. They are aged 15-16 and somewhat gifted. The local currriculum gives the topic: epistemology, but leaves choices regarding content and teaching methods up to the teacher. Do you happen to have ideas regarding excerzices or material to teach? Links are also appreciated.

For a task I was thinkin something like a list of criteria for evaluating an idea or source. There was once a an SSC post with such a list that included points like assigning probabilities instead of a binary yes/no positions and being straightforward with both positive and negative sides. Can´t find this post anymore though, maby someone knows it and can post a link? 

Also mindsets, like the [scout/warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4RLfVxTGH4) distinction Julia Galef discusses, could be useful.

Another point could be made by looking at [studies](https://www.businessinsider.com/quantitative-perceptions-of-probability-words-2017-5?r=US&IR=T&IR=T) that investigated probabilites people assigned to everyday words like ""perhaps"" or ""likely"" and how they differ between people which makes the case for using numbers a viable choice when thinking probabilistically. 

Different [visual illusions](https://twitter.com/AkiyoshiKitaoka/status/1079322812664279045) could be useful in introducing a healthy scepticism towards sense perceptions? 

The difference between top-down and bottom up processing could be useful, any good excersizes or ideas on how to teach this?

If you have other ideas feel free to share. Too long and abstract texts dont work very well with them, but othervise the students are intersted and curios.

"Yesterday, I ate a pizza at Domino's. It was so greasy that I could see a small pool of butter under the pizza, the pepperoni was impressively bland and the rest of the pizza tasted like nothing at all. To add insult to injury, the pizza was notably smaller than a typical 'large pizza' and even more expensive than the pizza at my local family-run pizzeria. Nonetheless, I could see that there were quite a few orders, and the company has more than [13,000](https://www.google.com/search?q=domino%27s+number+of+locations&rlz=1C1GCEA_enNO811NO811&oq=domino%27s++number+of+locations&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.4897j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) locations the world over. In the decade or so that I've been patronizing my local pizzeria, they've managed to grow enough to support one other location. 

Ordering a pizza from one of the many small and cheap low-brow pizzerias can be unpredictable, but if you can try out several different ones, you will ultimately discover a hidden gem: a pizzeria that is both awesomely cheap and impressively delicious. However, these hidden gems will struggle to compete with the economies of scale and brand recognition that major brands have, meaning that the patchwork of informal, brilliant restaurants that grew with a given community are slowly replaced with mediocre franchises that fail to serve their customers good, cheap food as they squeeze their suppliers and hire people into badly paid, meaningless work. 

Because I don't want to live in the [Brazilia](http://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/state_brasilia1.png) of mediocre restaurants, I want to find out what can be done to ensure that we stop a monoculture of franchise restaurants from outcompeting the ""hidden gems"" that fail to market themselves as effectively.

"A little context. I was chatting to a friend about purchasing premium versions of mobile apps, and he was shocked that I'd bother with them: it seemed to him a big waste of money. I pointed out that he'd spent $600 on a snowboard he uses once a year, whereas I use these apps multiple times a week. I've had a similar discussion with a friend about food delivery vs Uber, each of us considering one an extravagance and the other a natural thing to spend money on.

The civilised thing to do in these contexts seems to be to go relativist: it's your money, and as long as it fits in your budget, we should consider your purchases as rational as anyone else's. But I doubt many of us really buy that. After all, we've all had buyer's remorse in extreme cases, where we see that a purchase was stupid. How much more often must it happen that we fail to notice - whether through motivated reasoning or sheer inattention - that we spent money on something that didn't offer much reward.

So, I'm curious what strategies this sub uses to determine things like value for money and what should be counted a rare luxury. I realise there are unlikely to be any realistic comprehensive approaches here, so I'm looking mainly for heuristics or philosophies.

I also recognise we're getting into deep and (for many of us) likely familiar waters. I know a fair amount about the psychology of happiness, and I know that it's claimed that, eg, [experiences rather than objects lead to greater payoffs in terms of happiness](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090207150518.htm). But I'm a little suspicious of some of these results, first because happiness seems to me only one component of well being, and second, because measurement of happiness is still a deeply fraught business.

I was surprised to learn that flat planes of metal are scraped with the equivalent of a hard, sharp spoon (a curved working surface) in order to get a flat surface within 1/10,000th of an inch.  So-called ""five tenths"", i.e. 5/10,000ths of an inch, is a more typical spec.  I had expected that a flat working surface is a fundamental principle of working metal to flatness.

Instead, what we see in the video is a man working a ""spoon"" on a reasonably flat surface.  The spoon scrapes up small amounts of metal.  He uses dyes to show the high spots and scrapes those, avoiding the low spots.  The spoon has long handle or lever arm, about as long as the man's arm.  One end is held at his shoulder, his other hand in the middle of the lever pulling it down, applying pressure to the work, inducing a slight bow to the lever arm.  The other end has a sharp, crescent shaped bit, which digs a shallow, curved trough into the work. 

My guess is that the mini ocean which is created can be controlled within a certain threshold -- that this surface is ""flat to within X tenths"" where a tenth is a ten thousandth of an inch.   Furthermore, my guess is that when you take a ""rough"" surface that is flat to within 5 tenths, you later get a smoother surface which is flat to within 3 or 1 tenths.  This is via ""lapping"".

Lapping.  This is my alternative hypothesis to the best method of achieving flatness.  The basic idea is to rub two bricks against each other.  Eventually you will achieve a very flat surface, the working surface that rubs between the two bricks.  You can recalibrate a whetstone by rubbing it against its mate.

My guess is that the scraping technique, when carried out to deliver a certain spec, say 5 tenths, achieves over time an improved surface for work hardening and curing which results in a flatter work surface at a better spec like say 3 tenths.

- Requests for advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

"This is sort of a dumb thing probably everybody knows but I just discovered in adulthood, and thought I'd share with other slow people like me.

You ever have a conversation with somebody in the shower?  I don't mean a real shower partner but a totally imaginary conversation.  You argue some point with somebody and it's a total slam-dunk.  Or you're giving a lecture and somehow in your head it always comes out perfectly.

Then you're with the actual person and the same topic comes up.  You try to recall your perfect monologue, you grope around in your head (""I came up with it in the shower, how could I have lost it?"") and try to recover pieces of it while on the spot with this person.  Or you give up and try to create it all over again, but you can't seem to muster the passion you had in the shower and it still ends up looking like a grab for disjointed facts or points, and not the beautiful that came out in the shower (of course it has not been proven that even if the daydream were played back in high fidelity, that it would actually be any good).

In any other artistic field we take for granted that the picture you have in your head is going to be damn hard to reproduce on canvas.  The mental picture is an ideal of perfection that can never actually be reached, but can be approximated more and more closely with more effort.

Even in oratory, we seem to naturally understand that you must rehearse your speech.  If you don't rehearse it it's not going to come out like it was when you first came up with it, not even if you wrote it down and memorized the words.  There's a whole act of perfecting it that you must undertake, and you have to decide *how* perfect you want it, because we don't have forever.

Now for a dialogue, this is basically impossible.  If it's a really important dialogue you might try rehearsing a number of various permutations of directions the chat might take, but you'll never come up with them all, and even if you could, you could never practice them all due to combinatorial explosion.  So you pick the most important points that might come up and practice each of them.

A better technique that looks more natural and confident is to memorize your stances on various issues that might come up, so that you can draw on those stances at a moment's notice, but otherwise improvise the conversation.

But in general probably the only thing that will ever move you closer to having conversations resembling the ones you have in the shower, is to talk to more people and have more conversations with them.  To practice conversation in general, so that you get better at it.  One thing you might want to look out for is when there are topics you recoil from in your in-person conversation but will speak eloquently on in the shower.  This ice will naturally have to be broken before you will ever actualize this idea.

"Suppose everybody knows that it's crucial to have the tallest population possible.  Politicians ceaselessly debate which policies are the most effective way to have the tallest population.  Like a Good Scientist you decide to conduct a RCT and find that if an adolescent consumes an additional 100 calories/day for 5 years, their adult height will increase by 1 centimeter.  Suppose the average adolescent consumes 1,600 calories/day and the average adult has a height of 166 cm.

    HEIGHT ~ 0.01 (cm/cal) * cal + 150 cm

Suppose the standard deviation for calorie consumption is 150 calories, and the standard deviation for height is 10cm.  Then the correlation is 0.15, and calorie-consumption accounts for 2% of the variance in height.

Now let's conduct the same study in the year 1200, where calorie consumption was more variable.  If slope remains the same, but the standard deviation in calories consumed increases to 450, then correlation increases to a much more respectable 0.45 and explains 20% of the variance in height.

If the politicians pay attention to your correlation results, then, if the year is 1200, they may conclude feeding every adolescent an additional 200 calories/day is an appropriate policy, but if the year is 2000 they might dismiss calorie consumption as a terrible approach and try something else.

You go online and in the year 2000 people say that height is just an intrinsic property you're born with, but in the year 1200 everyone condemns the aristocrats for hoarding all the food for themselves.  Of course this is all ridiculous!  In both cases the additional 200 calories/day results in the exact same change in height!

The point of this hypothetical is that when it comes to actually making a decision (instead of winning Internet debates or publishing papers about ""how important X is"") the question is about comparing the benefits of a change in Y with the costs required to change X (replace with non-causal language as needed), and this is typically best understood in the original units, \*not\* z-scores.

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of December 24, 2018

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

I wrote up a (speculative) summary of how some of the ideas we're working with at QRI might describe what's happening during meditation at Marr's 'algorithmic' level. Here's [a link to the piece](http://opentheory.net/2018/12/the-neuroscience-of-meditation/), and below are some excerpts (there's more in the actual piece). Comments welcome, and if you know specific people who would be interested or who you think I should get in touch with, please let me know. Thank you!

>The core tool of Buddhism is meditation. Empirically, it seems to work for many people. But *how*does it work? There are a lot of good ‘generalist’ books in this space– Robert Wright’s *Why Buddhism is True*, Culadasa’s *The Mind Illuminated*. My favorite attempt to date to unify Eastern and Western thought is Shinzen Young’s *The Science of Enlightenment--*  
...  
I think a really powerful way to keep track of all of this is parallel description. In other words, we can attempt to describe what’s going on during suffering & during meditation at multiple levels of abstraction, and the more stories we can identify and weave together and cross-validate, the better our understanding will get. In particular, if we get ‘stuck’ on describing what’s happening on one level, we can hop to another level and try to see what’s going on from there. I also believe we should be *neuroscience snobs* and only deal with neuroscience models that the *very best*neuroscientists are currently excited about, since the difference between an ‘industry standard’ neuroscience paradigm and a ‘best in the world’ paradigm is really enormous. Mostly people talk about better neuroscience being more elegant and predictive, but I think it’s even more important to not import old confusions, outdated and wrong ways of looking at the brain. As the saying goes, ‘It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.’

I offer four parallel descriptions of what meditation is doing in the brain, drawing from various neuroscience frameworks-- some excerpts:

**Buddhism** (i.e. Pali Canon):

>Buddhism claims the self arises through the presence of craving and *identifying* with this craving, and this delusion, or ‘defilement,’ propagates through and infects our entire experience. Meditation helps because by ‘noting and knowing’ experiences which arise, we can notice their impermanence, and notice that what we call the ‘self’ is an illusion and our sensations don’t really have an ‘owner.’ Over time as we keep doing this, we slowly generate the inference space to build better intuitive perspectives on the *real* dynamics of our minds, and we feel less of a compulsion to reflexively cling to our objects of craving or aversion (or the craving/aversion itself). This ‘spaciousness’, or freedom from the usual web of intentionality, allows us to develop the seven enlightenment factors (mindfulness, wisdom, energy, rapture, relaxation, concentration, equanimity), and ultimately the conditions which sustain the self / craving / suffering can drop away.

**Predictive Coding** (i.e. Friston's Free Energy Principle):

>Predictive coding is a formal framework which says that the brain’s core drive is to *minimize surprise*, and that it does this by constantly creating, testing, and adjusting *stories* about the world. This is a two-tier system: the first ‘tier’ is subconscious prediction, which tries to filter out the ‘easy stuff’ using simple algorithms. You don’t feel the weight of your shirt against your skin, or the pressure of your shoes, or hear the traffic in the background, because this stuff is easy for your brain to categorize then ignore. But if your brain’s subconscious can’t predict something— say you get bitten by a snake, or you fail a midterm you thought you passed— then this stuff gets sent up for the *conscious mind* to deal with. Essentially, the mind is a story-telling machine, and we make our stories out of the ‘unusual’ signals the unconscious brain can’t explain away. The more surprising/salient something is, the more the brain thinks it’s probably important and should be a part of whatever story we’re telling ourselves, and the more ‘sticky’ it feels. ... Under the predictive coding model, I’d describe the process of meditation as attempting to ‘tag’ sensations early in the prediction pipeline as “okay/nothing to worry about/not anomalous/not something to update on/doesn’t have to be part of our story”, before the sensation becomes high-confidence and sticky and *needs* to be part of the story.

**Connectome-specific harmonic waves**:

>All systems with periodic activity have natural modes, frequencies they ‘like’ to resonate at. Wineglasses, tuning forks, and guitars have them; the brain has them too. Connectome-specific harmonic waves (CSHW) is a new but promising paradigm for *defining* and *measuring* these natural harmonic modes in brains. ... How does meditation affect the brain? In the short-term, the ‘noting and knowing’ of meditation may act to dampen specific harmonics before their activity spills over into others and becomes self-propagating, leading to a quieter mind with a better signal-to-noise ratio.

**Neural annealing**:

>Annealing involves heating a metal above its recrystallization temperature, keeping it there for long enough for the microstructure of the metal to reach equilibrium, then slowly cooling it down, letting new patterns crystallize. This releases the internal stresses of the material, and is often used to restore ductility (plasticity and toughness) on metals that have been ‘cold-worked’ and have become very hard and brittle— in a sense, annealing is a ‘reset switch’ which allows metals to go back to a more pristine, natural state after being bent or stressed. I suspect this is a useful metaphor for brains, in that they can become hard and brittle over time with a build-up of internal stresses, and these stresses can be released by periodically entering high-energy states where a more natural neural microstructure can reemerge. ... Furthermore, from what I gather from experienced meditators, *successfully entering meditative flow may be one of the most reliable ways to reach these high-energy brain states*.

Much of this is unabashed speculation, but with some testable implications. Full article [here](http://opentheory.net/2018/12/the-neuroscience-of-meditation/).

"I’m a big fan of content curation. I’m always on the hunt for best-of lists and I prefer sorting subreddits by top-of-all-time. But it bothers me that review aggregation in most domains doesn’t seem to be that great. This  [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/937/) highlights one of the biggest issues. If something is rated “4 stars”, it doesn’t really give that much information about its quality. It could be amazingly good for some people but a few people couldn't get it to work, or it could be decent for most people and horribly bad for a small minority. This problem is especially acute in domains where “rating inflation” has lead to almost everything being close to 5 stars (e.g. Uber or AirBnB). 

In an economics sense, it seems there are two main issues with consumer reviews/ratings:

**Reviews have positive externalities, and therefore are underproduced.**  

An accurate review could allow thousands of other consumers to make better decisions worth thousands of dollars to them, but the reviewer gets nothing much than the satisfaction of writing the review. (On a somewhat unrelated note - could leaving useful reviews be a mildly decent form of effective altruism?)

This can be partially internalised by professional reviewers, like movie critics. (Professional critics also have an incentive to avoid rating inflation). And I’ve found at least one case of a company incentivising lay reviewers - Amazon has the [Early Reviewer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202094910) program. But any review incentive system has the problem of being gamed. (Amazon also has a big issue with fake reviews). 

Still, there are plenty of domains that I wish there were more reviews. For instance, individual podcast episodes almost never have reviews, despite the fact there are often extensive archives of very lengthy episodes that I wish could be curated in any way at all. 


**Preference intensity is not effectively measured**.  

This is the crux of the XKCD comic. “Five stars” can mean anywhere from “pretty good” to “saved my life”, and “one star” can mean anything from “mildly annoying” to “killed my family”. 

In a perfect world, every consumer of a product would leave a rating that exactly equaled their consumer’s surplus in dollars (a positive or negative amount saying how much more (or less) they’d be willing to pay for the product than they actually did). Combined with a good [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Collaborative_filtering) algorithm, you could theoretically produce almost perfect product recommendations. 

For instance, in the aforementioned XKCD, TornadoGuard’s 5 star reviews would probably represent a willingness to pay of only a few cents, while its 1 star review would be represented by a willingness to pay potentially in the negative thousands of dollars or more. The average rating (in dollars) would thus be strongly negative. 

The problem is, of course, that’s it really hard to get people to sincerely report their willingness-to-pay. If you could achieve that, than you could also solve many other public goods problems (or more selfishly, perfectly price discriminate among your customers).

But maybe there are some ways that you could get - maybe not perfect willingness-to-pay - but just a little more precision in preference intensity? Some existing examples are scarce/premium features like Reddit Gold or Tinder super-likes. Perhaps regular reviewers on a given service could get one “gold” rating per ten reviews that they can give out to something they really liked. Or maybe there could be some kind of mini-prediction market where you’re incentivised for being able to predict the preferences of others? (I guess this would almost like buying stocks in a product).

----

The best argument against these musings is the efficient market hypothesis. Amazon and many other giant tech firms would benefit tremendously from an improved reviewing process, so the fact they haven’t adopted any of these ideas is a good signal they won’t work. On the other hand, it’s possible that there’s a “weirdness penalty” to any exotic reviewing system that makes it a bad idea for any mainstream service to switch to, but it’s possible an early adopter could prove its merits.

"Arnett (2008) published an [analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18855491) of the psychology literature in major journals from 2003 to 2007 and found that 68% of studies were done on American subjects and 96% were on industrialized Western subjects. So really, what we know about human psychology is only about humans living in industrialized Western nations; to the extent that those kinds of humans differ from other kinds of humans we have limited information about the other kinds. 

Heinrich, Heine, & Norenzayan (2010) ([study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/weirdest-people-in-the-world/BF84F7517D56AFF7B7EB58411A554C17), [popular article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/primate-diaries/the-weird-evolution-of-human-psychology/)) show that they do, in fact, differ. For example, the [Muller-Lyer illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion) affects Westerners much more than non-Westerners. The researchers speculate that the illusion is in fact not an intrinsic feature of human cognition, but a culturally evolved by-product of modern environments, in particular of the straight lines and right angles of most of the buildings that Westerners live in.

They go through many more examples and it’s really fascinating and you should read it. As a summary: When compared to non-Westerners, Westerners are unusually generous when playing the [dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_game) and [ultimatum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game) games, unusually likely as children to reason about their environment in terms of humans rather than other animals, and unusually likely to reason about space in relative rather than absolute terms. Of course, the point of their paper isn’t to draw attention to what we know about the difference between Western and non-Western populations but what we *don’t know* and just assume is universal because no one’s ever bothered to do a cross-cultural study. 

But, of course, these studies are from a decade ago. And there’s a good chance you heard of them back then, and if *you* heard about then, then surely the *professional researchers* heard about them too and adjusted their practices appropriately. Right?

I haven’t been able to find a more recent paper that analyzes the same journals as Arnett (2008). But [Nielsen et al. (2017)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/psyifp/aekaertner/nielsen__m.__haun__d.__k__rtner__j.____legare__c.__2017_._the_persistent_sampling_bias_in_developmental_psychology.pdf) analyze the developmental psychology literature and show the the proportion of studies with subjects from Latin America, Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Israel actually slightly decreased from 8.33% in 2008 to 7.63% in 2015. And [Pollet & Saxton (2018)](https://osf.io/7h24p) analyze two evolutionary psychology journals from 2015 to 2016 and find that 81% of samples were Western, with only 4.5% from Latin America or Africa. I guess these are both higher than the ~4% non-Western samples found in Arnett. But not by much.

Okay, so Western psychologists mostly study Western subjects, and as a result most of their knowledge about psychology might only apply to Westerners. But at least we know about Westerners. At least we can be confident that if you live in the West and interact with other Westerners that everyone  you interact with will be susceptible to the Mulller-Lyer illusion and offer just under half of the money in the dictator and ultimatum games and give directions in terms relative to themself rather than to absolute landmarks. Right?

Arnett also found that in 67% of American studies and 80% of non-American studies, the sample consisted of undergraduate psychology students. Not undergraduate students; undergraduate students *majoring in psychology*. Two-thirds of studies about human psychology are done on people currently beginning their careers in the study of psychology just because they’re the ones most accessible by the people doing the research. This means that it’s not just non-Westerners who are underrepresented in psychology research; Westerners not between the ages of 18 and 22, Westerners from social strata that don’t attend college, and even Western college students who don’t major in psychology make up only a small slice of subjects. This probably doesn’t matter in the context of the findings referenced above, which have been studied extensively on a diverse range of subjects, but I would be surprised if it didn’t matter at all.

My title is a bit click-baity; in fact we know a lot about human psychology, we just know it about a very small proportion of humans. This is mostly old news but I’m posting it now anyway because it’s so important that it should really be brought up any time anyone discusses any study about psychology and that the number of people who don’t know it should be zero.

"My friend, who we can call “Jim,” is a professional psychiatrist and therapist in New York City. I have no professional psych experience at all.

My friend told me about a patient of his, who we can call “Dave.”

Dave is in his early late 20s and has a decently paying job in finance. He went to a good school, is healthy, and has a girlfriend he is generally happy with. But Dave is not happy because he is always anxious or depressed.

When pressed on why he is anxious and depressed, Dave says that he believes the world is going to hell. Specifically, he thinks a lot about all the horrible poverty in the world, especially in Africa and Asia. He is worried about climate change, rampant pollution, and believes humanity is slowly poisoning the earth. He is worried about the rise of Trump in America, plus similar right wing nationalist forces in Europe, and can see the political West moving in a darker direction. Dave thinks about all these trends a lot and concludes that the world is a miserable place, and getting worse.

Jim’s therapeutic approach to helping Dave is to challenge him on his object-level beliefs. Through a series of easy-going conversations, Jim tried to convince Dave that the world isn’t as bad as he thinks, and is getting better. Jim recommended that Dave read Steven Pinker’s “Enlightenment Now,” and directed his attention to numerous articles and websites which show that global poverty is plummeting, humanity has never been better suited to confront environmental problems, and the nationalist political backlash probably won’t last long.

I thought Jim’s response was strange. My therapeutic instinct is to shift away from the object-level details, and focus more on Dave’s meta-cognitive strategies. I would try to encourage Dave to take a more stoic approach to world affairs. Yes, there are bad things going on in the world, but Dave cannot control those things and therefore should try to focus his attention on what he can control. His individual life is basically going well, and he should be happy about that. He could devote some time and energy to charities or environmental/political causes, but he shouldn’t let such abstract, distant issues keep him up at night.

Of course, these strategies are not mutually exclusive. Jim also suggested that Dave should spend less time thinking about these issues, and I would tell Dave that the world is not as bad as he thinks. But by the constraints of time and energy (and only having two hours of therapy per week), one strategy needs to be prioritized over the other.

&#x200B;

What do you think? Which strategy makes more sense?

My instinct is that trying to convince Dave that all of these problems are not as bad as he thinks won’t work. Even if you can convince him to disagree with the messages he absorbs from his friends, the media, etc, there are too many catastrophes to combat. Even if I can convince Dave that poverty is falling and climate change can be fought, Dave will then worry about declining bee populations, or the depleting ozone layer, or the depleting coral reefs, or whatever. It’s all too surface level for me. The fundamental problem is that Dave’s locus of value is detached from himself, so he feels distant problems too acutely. We need to readjust his locus back to the individual and perhaps a family.

Jim’s counter is that I am asking for too big of a shift in Dave’s mind. Maybe we can shit Dave’s meta-cognition eventually, but that could take months or years of therapy.  In the meantime, he will suffer. And there is no guarantee he will shift at all when we are asking so much of him. Plus, the more of Dave’s worries we solve (convince him that poverty is falling, that climate change won’t destroy earth, etc.), the more resistant he will be too future catastrophizing. We can build a new skepticism in his mind that makes him more reliant.",Disagreement with a friend on offering therapeutic advice,a7vgdr,new,21,25,25,0
"Part one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/a767lr/locke_on_property/).  While we may pass close to some CW topics (Locke was a Whig activist!) I hope discussion remains civil.

We left off with the “wild Indian” in the state of nature establishing property over those things they use for nourishment.  I wasn’t sold on some of the specifics, but the broad point (right to sustenance + personal liberty + enduring commons = property) seems solid.  Note the “enduring commons” part of that equation: we’ve only established property rights if the commons is not meaningfully diminished.  Once the commons becomes scarce, Locke no longer gives us property.

Locke then puts another quick limit on property, citing 1 Timothy 6:17, which reads “God has given us all things richly to enjoy”.  Locke makes hay out of “to enjoy”, limiting the acquisition of property to “as much as anyone can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils”.

Now we can move on to the interesting stuff: land!

>I think it is plain, that property in \[land\] too is acquired as the former.  As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property...

How does land work? The same way as everything else!  That was easy; let’s go get lunch.

.

.

OK, just kidding.

Locke really doesn’t say much directly about land.  To the extent a man can use land, he can take it.  What is further said about land requires a bit of interpretation.  I’ll pull heavily from the text while I interpret, because there’s a good chance I’ll get something wrong.  Heading off an early objection, let’s keep in mind we haven’t introduced civil society or money yet, so Locke’s arguments here are to some extent hypothetical: they’re about the “state of nature” rather than 1680s England.  It’s not always clear when Locke is speaking hypothetically versus speaking about current/future conditions, so we’ll try to interpret him charitably on that front.

The first interesting claim is that land, like acorns, can be accumulated as property while leaving “still enough, and as good” for others.  It’s clear here that Locke is speaking of the hypothetical man in the state of nature, but he then extends this claim to the 1680s:

>\[man might've appropriated land as Locke describes\] without injury to anybody in the first ages of the world, when men were more in danger to be lost, by wandering from their company, in the then vast wilderness of the earth, than to be straitened for want of room to plant in.  And the same \[appropriation\] may be allowed still, without prejudice to anybody, full as the world seems.  For supposing a man, or family, in the state they were, at first peopling of the world by the children of Adam, or Noah; let him plant in some inland, vacant places of America, we shall find that the possessions he could make himself upon the measures we have given, would not be very large, nor, even to this day, prejudice the rest of mankind …

While Locke cites “vacant places of America” as the source of new land for appropriation, he might have also thought it possible, in theory, for new land to be available in England.  This disconnect between theoretical availability (maybe possible) and actual availability (no chance) in England comes from the invention of money.  Money changed the way men valued things, and led to all England being claimed, even if all England was not strictly useful for sustenance.  Let’s stay away from money for now and jump to another claim about land:  English Commons are acceptable as commons, and can’t be claimed by individuals.

Locke gives us two reasons Commons are acceptable, without making it clear whether either is sufficient or necessary.  First, Commons exist by law in societies “under government”, with “money and commerce”.  This makes them common not to mankind, but common only to people of that society -- “joint property of this country, or this parish”.  The Commons in England are claimed jointly by the English people, and this co-ownership is evidently valid property.  Second, Locke gives an argument based on… divinely mandated utility maximization?:

>Besides, the remainder, after such enclosure, would not be as good to the rest of the commoners as the whole was, when they could all make use of the whole: whereas in the beginning and first peopling of the great common of the world, it was quite otherwise.  The law man was under, was rather for appropriating.  God commanded, and \[man’s\] wants forced him to labour.  That was his property which could not be taken from him wherever he had fixed it.

I had never heard this side of Locke before.  The rules have changed in England, and the primordial rule of property-through-labor no longer applies.  The day laborer working in the Devonshire Common gains no claim to the land, though he mixes his labor with it.  The reason here cited for this change is based on the utility of “the commoners”.  Apparently, in addition to the explicit restrictions, the rule of property-through-labor relies on the increased utility provided by enclosed land!  If society reaches the point where commons are more valuable for the commoners than the right to enclose, then the right to enclose no longer (necessarily) holds.

Finally a third claim, also touching on utility: land is meant to be parceled and cultivated.  Locke doesn’t explore the possibility of land being common and cultivated, or parceled and uncultivated.  He instead sees two options, with the first being superior: parceled and cultivated versus common and uncultivated.

>God gave the world to men in common, but since he gave it them for their benefit, and the greatest conveniences of life they were capable to draw from it, it cannot be supposed he meant it should always remain common and uncultivated.  He gave it to the use of the industrious and rational, (and labour was to be his title to it;) not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious. . .  
>  
>he who appropriates land to himself by his labour, does not lessen but increase the common stock of mankind.  For the provisions serving to the support of human life, produced by one acre of enclosed and cultivated land, are (to speak much within compass) ten times more, than those, which are yielded by an acre of land, of an equal richness, lying waste in common.

Again a double argument: first theological justification for the industrious and rational, second the increase in effective land provided by enclosure and cultivation.  Note the second argument is quite reasonable in Locke’s hypothetical circumstances: the cultivator uses 1 acre of private land rather than 10 acres of public land, leaving 9 bonus acres of public land for others.  That's it for Locke on land, provided I'm reading him well.

I have more thoughts on land, and I found this section tough.  First, what is Locke thinking about the Indians?  He uses them as an example of persons in the state of nature, and refers to America as a huge tract of uncultivated land.  Despite justifying common ownership in England, he doesn’t seem to think about common ownership for Indian groups, or demonstrate much knowledge about actual Indian life.  On the other hand, he claims only the “inland, vacant places of America” as valid for appropriation, so he doesn’t directly endorse taking land from the Indians.  Is it possible he thought the land sufficient for new settlers, while granting the Indians their thousands of uncultivated acres?  Did he believe the Indians needed to adopt both efficient cultivation AND individual (rather than communal) property in order to have justified claims?  I’ve encountered an argument, set up against Locke, that Indians labored on their eastern forests by annually burning them to manage the ecosystem.  Now I’m not sure if that argument responds to Locke: it seems possible he thought the Indians had valid property claims even if they didn't improve their land.

Second, what the hell does Locke think qualifies as “still enough, and as good” for land?  If I take the last bit of free land in England, it’s OK, because the next guy can sail across the ocean and start a new life in a dangerous country?  This doesn’t look good to me.  Locke must have noticed there was a hard problem here: everywhere on earth there’s relatively good and relatively bad land, with more demand for the former then the latter.

Finally, the business about the rule of property-through-labor no longer applying.  Though there’s a justification based on government, Locke presents a separate justification about the English Commons being more useful to the commoners as commons, than they would be as enclosed land.  This is the first step Locke has taken towards the problem of limited common resources: once the supply in the commons drops low enough that further appropriation isn’t beneficial (to the commoners), further appropriation isn’t allowed.  This rule of course only works in a few cases, and it’s not clear to me who gets to be involved in utility calculations, but I’m happy to see the attempt.  I’m also surprised I’ve never heard it, given how often people make fun of Locke’s property-through-labor rule.

* Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; *encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people* \(if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it\).

"I am writing in this forum as many of you might come from a similar background. Recently I have finished my master in mathematics and management (it is a math degree with a few business classes like accounting, micro, macro, finance, management). 

My big 5 personality:

* extremely high in openness, (try to learn new things constantly),
* medium-high in conscientiousness (can work very hard if I have a project that I enjoy, other times my openness can lead to procrastination),
* medium-high in extraversion (high in assertiveness, I enjoy people but do not always need to be around them),
* very low in agreeableness,
* pretty low in neuroticism.

I have good knowledge about statistics/data science, optimization, psychology and all the basic economics/business stuff. I enjoy solving problems and coming up with creative solutions, but I do not want to be a hardcore techie and prefer to be a generalist over a specialist.

My dream occupation would be to look holistically at a company (processes, structure, strategy), try to figure out weaknesses and propose solutions with or without technology. Is there anything like that or am I just dreaming something up? Also, ideally somewhere in the farther future I'd like to be self employed. I have looked at business analysts which tend into that direction. However, they do not seem to look at a company as a whole and I fear that often they end up just being the mediator between management and IT.

I love reading these and the book recommendations, but it is clear that the speed and logic of people around here is eons ahead of my operating system;  reading in slow motion is very necessary.

My jobs since college have been working class, entry level. I had good grades at college studying elementary teaching but it was never the right option for me long-term. Anxiety issues, over-thinking and not being able to make decisions have always plagued me. I would love to find a meaningful job perhaps in something like global health or development, but in my late 20's I'm not sure I can afford to go back to university.  I lived and worked in rural East-Africa prior to college and comfortable living in poorer countries. That being said, I simply am not cut out to become a doctor, epidemiologist or computer-based, hard logic jobs.

80,000 hours explains that their advice is for ""talented and ambitious graduates..."", but I suspect even they underestimate just how far beyond the average Joe Bloggs they are. Note: I might be wrong here and happy to be critiqued. I've never attended an EA event but it almost seems like everyone posting is hyper-rational, System 2 exclusive, Ivy-league or Oxford grads only. Reading 80,000 hours career options, it's almost comical how out of touch most of their options are. The guys that run these things are insanely genius level smart, but I feel like none of the guidance I've seen  would help the average person and is devoid of any emotional drive that I think is necessary to motivate you long-term. The most helpful things I've found have been  Jonathan Haidt's Happiness Hypothesis, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Flow book, Man's Search for Meaning and Jordan Peterson's original lectures for trying to orient myself better. I actually wish the EA community would address more specifically when emotions and irrationality (System 1/ instinct) are useful, like Dan Ariely and Jonathan Haidt have in their work.

"The man himself:

>I shall endeavour to show, how men might come to have a property in several parts of that which God gave to mankind in common, and that without any express compact of all the commoners.

What an interesting pitch!  The bit about God having given the Earth to mankind in common needs a little context.  This passage comes from the second treatise of “Two Treatises of Government”.  The first treatise was a scathing rebuttal of the argument that God gave the Earth to Adam and his heirs.  The gift of the earth to heirs of Adam then justified absolute monarchy underneath the monarchs (as heirs of Adam), because the monarchs owned all the Earth.  So here in the second treatise, Locke is referencing his arguments in the first. “That which God gave to mankind in common” means “God gave the earth to mankind for sustenance, without making any particular distinctions for individual humans, or really mentioning property at all”.  So Locke’s going to start with a property-less world, given to mankind in common for sustenance, and derive us some ownership.

We will also need some other ~~natural rights~~ nonsense on stilts, but I’ll introduce those as we go.

Locke begins by discussing the right of every human, once born, to sustain themselves: people have a right to food and shelter; those things necessary to life.  He cites “natural reason” as one source of this right, and the divine revelation to Adam and Noah as another.  I’m happy to grant this and move on, with one little caveat: these rights entitle us to only the fruits of nature necessary for sustained life.  They don’t entitle us to the fruits of labor.  In \~1680 Locke didn’t have to worry about a potential divine/natural right to dialysis machines, so we won’t worry about one either.

Having established a divine right to sustenance, Locke takes stock of the situation.  No one has a right to property, but everyone has a right to sustenance.  The “wild Indian” is our stand-in for humanity in this original position:

>The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it.

To understand this, let’s introduce another natural/divine right Locke is working with: liberty in one’s body.  Men have the right to themselves, and their labors, and their actions, to the extent permitted by the natural law.  This extent is rather broad, only excluding things like violence, wasting the commons, and such.  There’s more interesting stuff here on natural law, but I’ll skip it.

So the wild Indian, with rights to sustenance and his own body, gains property in this passage!  Specifically, he gains ownership of the food that he consumes, since as it becomes a part of his body, other men lose their rights over it.  Now this transition is interesting -- at what point does another lose their rights to consumed venison?  The rights of bodily autonomy only partition off the venison from the commons when held in hand, or perhaps mastication is necessary, or some such intimate line.  The rights of a man to his labor extend their protection further, but are also more slippery.  The fruits of nature are given to mankind in common, so two men may find themselves hunting the same deer.  A reasonable rule might grant the venison to him that first wounds the animal, or that first stalks it, or perhaps the one to kill it extends his rights over his own labor over the carcass, overriding any prior labor of stalking or wounding.  Any reasonable rule like this does actually need reasons, but we don’t yet have any from Locke.  By the way, we’re getting ahead of Locke, so let’s head back to the text.  Locke states his principle, property based on labor:

>The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his.  Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined it to something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property…   
>  
>For this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good left in common for others.

Shamelessly dodging the hard problem, Locke slips in that bit at the end about labor only providing property if there’s enough and as good fruits of nature around for the next guy.  He does then grapple with the above question about the transition from commons to property, but resolves the problem by claiming the solution is obvious.  The solution isn’t obvious to me; here’s the line:

>He that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak, or the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly appropriated them to himself.  Nobody can deny but the nourishment is his.  I ask then, when did they begin to be his?  When he digested?  Or when he eat? Or when he boiled?  Or when he brought them home?  Or when he picked them up?  And ‘tis plain, if the first gathering made them not his, nothing else could.  That labour put a distinction between them and common.  That added something to them more than nature, the common mother of all, had done; and so they became his private right.

So I’m left a little unsatisfied here.  Talking about property in a world where there’s enough acorns to satisfy everyone is much less interesting than talking about property in a world with scarce acorns.  Plus, I’m still not following on why acorns become property immediately upon being picked up.  Locke claims this must be the case, but I’d prefer to put the line at taking the acorns home.  If I take acorns to a friend, but just pick them up on the way, I’d say “some acorns”.  If instead, I brought them from a stash of acorns at home, I’d say “my acorns”.  Not that there’s anything reasonable about my feelings here, but I don’t understand why Locke’s proposal is better.

\--------------------

I think that’s enough for one post, I’ll keep going tomorrow or the next day.  I read this book while traveling home for the holidays, and I figured I’d talk though a chapter for better understanding.  Happy to discuss/kill time over the holidays.

I’m using the 1993 Everyman version of the text, edited by Mark Goldie.  The full title is “Two Treatises of Government”, and I’m in section 2.5 “Of Property.”

"Declining social capital and atomization has been a growing topic in Western society, with much handwringing and lamentation in its wake. If you go back far enough in time, it's safe to say most people belonged to a community of some kind, and generally upheld its practices and supported their fellow members. And of course these groups were neither perfectly well-adjusted nor static, with members coming and going, and the groups themselves dissolving or forming.

To reach the current state of individuation, it seems that the birth/growth rate of many communities has been outweighed by the death/attrition rate.

Abstract: 


>A new and highly-cited literature on redistribution and economic policy-making paints a gloomy picture of democracy, which we refer to as the Subversion of Democracy Model (SDM). It comes in two varieties. One uses public opinion data to show that policies are strongly biased towards to the preferences of the rich; another uses macro- level data on inequality and redistribution to show that democratic governments are no longer responding to rising inequality. This paper is a critical reassessment of this literature. We point to methodological and theoretical issues that may bias the results, and we propose solutions that point to a very different interpretation of the data, which we refer to as the Representative Democracy Model (RDM). We test the SDM against the RDM on both public opinion data and a new dataset on fiscal policy and find that government policies largely reflect the economic preferences of the middle class, and that middle-class power has remained remarkably stable over time, even as inequality has risen. The rich have no or little influence on redistributive policies, and it does not appear that the democratic state is increasingly constrained by global capital.

"A recent Chinese high school cohort from the Sichuan province finished an experimental live streamed high school education (3 years). A report was released on Wednesday that claimed huge success.

A private education company convinced [Chengdu No. 7 High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengdu_No.7_High_School), one of the top performing high schools in terms of sending students to prestigious Chinese universities like Beijing and Tsinghua Universities, to live stream classes in real time to 248 rural high schools across the province. Students in the 248 rural high schools had their entire curriculum replaced with these live streamed classes and were required to do the same material and examination as the students in Chengdu No. 7. The rural teachers played an assistance role of trying to answer questions or scheduling extra study time for digesting the harder material.

The main standout result - prior to this program, 0 students from these rural high schools had been accepted into Beijing or Tsinghua University in any year. The live streaming cohort had 88 accepted (out of 72,000 students). It also mentioned that National College Entrance Examinations scores mildly improved in the 2nd year and greatly improved in the final 3rd year, albeit without providing any specific details.

The reporter included a lot of touching detail, including one story of a Chengdu No. 7 teacher realizing how many students were following along to his lectures and crying while watching video tributes from literally hundreds of high school classes.

Honestly I think the outcome is a little too incredible, even though there are some reputable first hand accounts. China did somewhat recently increase rural quotas for university admissions, but I wasn't able to find information on recent rural acceptance rates in other areas of China. It's annoying that data coming out of China is unreliable or missing detail, but on the other hand I think it's fantastic that China's political and cultural environment allows for the possibility for heavy-handed experiments.

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of December 17, 2018

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

"Lately, I’ve been seeing articles about the negative effects of social media, and I’ve also had multiple unprompted IRL conversations with people that are cutting back on their social media use. Some people are quitting platforms completely, and I even know 1 person that exchanged their smartphone for a dumb phone.

I was curious if this sub has any ideas on how to use social media responsibly. I feel like most people don’t put a lot of thought into how to use social media purposely, and quitting it entirely often seems like an overreaction.

Personally, I don’t use social media much. I feel like the decision not to be very active on social media somewhat hinders my progress in networking and developing friendships (e.g. someone with a lot of friends on social media has an easier time getting invited to interesting events). Developing content for Instagram/Snapchat feels more like a chore than something fun, so I currently avoid those platforms entirely. I enjoy things like Medium, and the intellectual-ish subs on Reddit. A lot of other social media content is just boring and not pertinent to me.

I’m more focused on this questions from a personal use perspective, but feel free to answer from a business marketing perspective.

"In [Next Door In Nodrumia](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/04/next-door-in-nodrumia/), Scott imagines a future where society is divided over the question of hobbyist-drumming.  He uses the hypothetical to explore laws & property rights.  I've been thinking about implications for etiquette.

Let's imagine that we're all in some midwestern city, fairly far removed from the center of the Drumia/NoDrumia fight.  Everyone's aware of it, but most city residents have 'normal' preferences.  There's the same individual variation we see in the real world.  Some people don't mind background noise, others hate it.

But, we have some California residents.  Immigrants from Pro-Drum areas tend to carry little bongo drums around, and play with them the way other people might play with a cellphone.  No Drumia immigrants *hate* this, and are strongly opposed to background noise in general.

Preferences are asymmetric; depriving a drummer of their drums is ""cellphone data gone for 8 hours"" level of significant obnoxiousness.  NoDrumia residents hate drums the way everyone else hates jackhammers.

Neither side has the power to change our local laws; so our question is purely about social etiquette.

----

Our Hiking Club is pretty chatty.  We go out for a walk once a week, typically with about 20 people.  Two of them moved from California to escape the drum laws, and like to tap on their bongo drums as they walk.  Bongos are a little louder than normal conversation, but not enough that anyone complains.  

Then, one day, our group mailing list is rocked by an especially nasty email.  Eirk Nodrum is a long term participant.  People realized he's from NoDrumia, but he hasn't complained about Jessica and Kate, our drummers, so everyone assumed he was cool with the noise.  It turns out he's been seething for the last year.

The email is particularly venomous.  Community sympathy is about evenly split; but most hikers aren't sure how to turn sympathy into a vote.  

Jessica & Kate point out that the group is pretty relaxed about most things.  The median member doesn't care enough about drumming for it to ruin their hike.  And if the club voted based on strong preferences, it would be 2:1.  

Erik points out that he's brought at least 5 new hikers to the club, all of them from NoDrumia, and all of them bailed when they realized that the group tolerated drumming.  So, if the club voted based on interested members, it's 2:6.

A random club member points out that Erik's arguments are things like, ""We can't hear birds,"" but that conversation probably scares birds too.  Would Erik be bothered by loud conversation?  Erik says he can (barely) tolerate it, but concedes that the 5 people he brought are less tolerant.

Questions:

**1.** Should the club members pass a rule protecting/prohibiting drums?

**2.** How strong is the moral imperative?  Is the right answer 'nice to have' or is it a moral imperative?

**3.** Do things change if the NoDrumia residents get a doctor's note saying that they can't function in environments with drums?

**4.** Do things change if Jessica & Kate show that hiking is one of the only places where drumming is still acceptable?  The doctors notes are common enough that most employers (+private businesses) ban drumming as a standard accommodation for disability.

-----

The club, based on the doctor's note, votes to ban drumming, and noises above a certain decibel level, to be voted later.  Jessica, Kate, and a few of the louder talkers found a splinter group that follows the exact rules as the original group 

Over the next couple years, Erik's group gradually changes its rules to ban all but the quietest conversation.  Jessica & Kate's group continues to chat, and gets back up to 20 people, and continues to chat. 

Eventually, a new immigrant from a NoDrumia shows up to Jessica & Kate's group.  They're unaware of the original fight.  The drums bother them, but they *really* want to hike.  Erik's schedule doesn't work for them, so they grit their teeth and bear it.

**5.** Does anything change the *second* time we have the fight?

**6.** How does a group set expectations about tolerating some amount of 'unprofessional' behavior, without becoming an explicit ""bash a symbol in the woods"" group?

**7.** What should people do if they're indifferent (/mildly opposed) to drums, but really like the ability to chat loudly?   These people don't want the group to be explicitly pro-drum, but there's a natural drift if drums get banned.

-----

To address culture-war: I'm hoping that it's enough to respond directly to a Slate Star Article.  

I'm also trying to use drumming in a fairly literal way.  It's an obnoxious behavior that varies in degree.  A tiny amount of drumming is barely noticeable, but a guy bashing a cymbal would actually be a problem on hikes.

This is a hard problem because there's a slippery slope without any obvious Schelling fences.  If some guy starts banging on a cymbal (or shouting / or singing) on a hike, we'd all be annoyed and tell him to shut up.  So, we're all in favor of drawing lines somewhere.

The problem is that, it's easy enough to imagine an actual, real-world human who was annoyed by drums (or talking / or whatever) showing up to a social event, and feeling legitimate discomfort.  The utilitarian thing seems to be to defer to the person who feels strongest.

"Hey Guys,

So, western judicial systems seem to be built on the idea that convicting an innocent man is far worst than exonerating a guilty man. You have ideas such as blackstone's ratio, franklin's ratio, etc.

This idea seems to have religious origins with similar principles being stated in the Hebrew & Christian bibles.

I'm just wondering if there has been any serious analysis on this, or do we just take this principle as a given?

I'm not disputing it in anyway, but what consideration has there been to a society that views convicting an innocent man as equally as bad as exonerating a guilty man. Perhaps this might reduce crime as fewer guilty men are set free? What analysis is there that tries to estimate the net effect on society from either view?

" The paper aims at building a conceptual framework on how user innovation concept may be employed for the idea of creating innovation network between universities and business. Such innovation network would serve different purposes that are currently qualified as barriers for innovation management in business organizations as lack of easy access to lead-user innovators; difficulties in building minimal viable products; problems in validating innovation in its pre-market phase, etc. On the other hand, such innovation network would also satisfy some identified problems in innovation management education like reducing the gap between theory and business; teaching students through real live projects, etc. The approach for designing the conceptual framework steps on the user innovation theory. A literature analysis on user innovation identifies the utility of utilizing users in innovation development. Based on these, a focus group with 15 innovation managers qualitatively validates whether the identified 26 user activities in innovation development from prior researches would be beneficial if students take the role of user innovators (educated user innovators). The conceptual framework is built as a result from the respondents’ answers by designing where students may participate in innovation development as user innovators and how beneficial it is expected to be that cooperation. The assessment aims also at define the best place where the proposed activities may take place within the innovation development process. The finding of the study may play the role of a roadmap for user utilization in innovation development.

"Often, harm does not increase linearly with use of some potentially harmful thing. Instead, use must rise to a certain threshold before harm-mitigating mechanisms are overwhelmed and harm occurs. 

Heavy use of one potentially harmful thing makes it easy to reach that threshold. 

If substitutes can be found, each having a different mechanism of action resulting in a different type of harm, they might be used in combination such that a harmful threshold is not reached.  

A fairly simple example would be a renewable resource like wood. You can take a certain amount of wood from a forest every year and still have a forest. It regenerates. It's fine until you start taking wood faster than the forest can grow it. Once you do that, you destroy the forest.

So if you have a bunch of people on an island who are using wood for every aspect of life, and they start taking wood faster than the forest can grow it, they might want to consider finding some wood-substitutes and start using them even if the wood-substitutes have their own associated risks or harm thresholds. 

I apologize if this seems super obvious to all of you, but I find that I'm usually trying to find a single good solution with minimal downsides. But sometimes a good solution doesn't exist or is not available for some reason. Sometimes you may want to consider employing multiple bad options in some workable combination as an improvement over a single bad option. 

Of course, if you're wrong about the thresholds, you may end up triggering multiple catastrophes when you could've had just one.

"So the brain segments the visible portion of the EM spectrum into N colors. But these colors seem to be a property of the brain itself, rather than a property of the particular EM wavelengths they represent. That is, phenomena like ""blue"" and ""red"" are in the mind, in the internal representation, not out there in greater reality, whatever that may actually be.

So does that mean the number of ""possible colors"" is infinite? 

If the brain is ""choosing"" how to represent particular wavelengths, then how it segments the visible spectrum is completely arbitrary. There is no direct mapping from the external phenomenon that is the EM spectrum to its internal representation in human minds.

So right now the visible spectrum is segmented into N colors, but theoretically, there's nothing to stop the brain from segmenting it into N+1, N*N, or N^N colors.

"I’ve spent a lot of time reading up on and thinking about productivity and self-help. There are a number of systems for getting specific tasks done (e.g. [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) or [Beeminder](https://beeminder.com)). However, I’ve yet to come across an all-in-one system that can really take you step-by-step through the entire self-improvement process, from helping you set and prioritise higher-level goals (not just passively asking you to write them), recommending you evidence-based lower-level goals that will help with your higher level goals (e.g. providing evidence-based weight-loss suggestions as part of a weight-loss goal), as well as having the specific task-tracking/organisaitonal features that the aforementioned systems help with.

 The closest thing I’ve found is [this 80,000 Hours article](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/.) summarising the best self-help evidence, in approximate order of priority. However, it’s not quite the step-by-step guide I’m looking for.
What I’m thinking of is something like following the steps in that guide in algorithmic fashion, e.g.

1. Do “Exercise A” (perhaps a quiz) to find out what you should initially prioritise. (For example it might turn out to be that getting more sleep is your lowest hanging-fruit, followed by doing more networking. Perhaps evidence shows that working on two domains is optimal, as more might be distracting).  
1. Try out the best evidence based steps B, C, and D for each of your priorities. Experiment according to system E.   
1. For each task, continue until condition F is met (e.g. you’ve succeeded in consistently sleeping 8 hours a night), then repeat Step 1 with new data (to find the new domains you should prioritise).  
1.  If condition F is not met, repeat Step 1 periodically (e.g. every month).

Although on paper my ideas might sound promising, I’ve spent a bit of time trying to create something like the above, and it hasn’t worked particularly well. I’m now unsure if the idea had any merit in the first place.

I also wonder how much efficacy self-help really can have. There’s a seductive idea, when reading about rationality and positive psychology, that people are constantly making biased decisions and don’t really know what makes them happy, and there exist a bunch of simple tips or systems that can massively improve people’s lives, if only everyone knew about them. If true, this would imply that there’s really tremendous altruistic benefits to spreading the best of those ideas or developing a truly popular and successful self-help system that implements them.

 But maybe this is wrong. For instance, Scott himself is [skeptical of the idea of rationality as winning](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bRGbdG58cJ8RGjS5G/no-really-why-aren-t-rationalists-winning#CTNA828sLA26q6AAE). Maybe most people have a pretty good “instrumental rationality” when it comes for things that actually matter, and LessWrong style rationality is mostly only helpful for weird internet arguments. And maybe positive psychology has some potential, but [I’ve become somewhat skeptical](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/7o08xu/will_applying_positive_psychologyhappiness/). Perhaps [rational choice theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory) models have been right all along. 

There’s also an intermediate possibility that some kind of effective, ultra-personalised self-help system could in fact work, but only with AI that is much better than today’s. Perhaps human motivation is so complex and varied that any simple system is unlikely to do much, but it would not be intractable for a sufficiently powerful AI. (However, it might be a relatively moot point if the level of AI that was required was sufficient to obsolete most human work by that stage).",Is it possible to boil down all of scientific self-help into a single system?,a5xvkq,new,11,9,9,0

"It seems to me there is no problem that interests humans that cannot be formulated as a discrete search problem, specifically in the form that there is some (often combinatorially large) set of objects S, and some optimal object O (or subset of objects that get satisfactorily close to O), and some search and evaluative function F that traverses S.

The central problem of human existence then becomes finding (searching for) ever better instantiations of F. Literally anything that humans care about, life, The Universe, everything, is just a search problem. Art, music, literature, medicine, engineering, architecture, spacecraft designs, gourmet food recipes, high tech materials, novel and useful molecules, alternative political systems, scientific hypotheses, interesting computer programs, mathematical proofs, all compile down to a search problem.

>An AGI system is going to be controlled by some program. Instead of trying to figure out the right program via human wizardry, we can just write a ""meta-algorithm"" to search program space, and automatically find the best program for making the AGI smart, and then use that program to operate the AGI. We can then repeat this meta-algorithm over and over, as the AGI gains more data about the world, so it will always have the operating program that’s best according to all its available data.

Guidelines:

The ""Scissor Statement"" is a headline of a media piece or a blog piece that gained a lot of traction and provoked a lot of anguish.

For the purposes of the awards, widespread political arguments which are too complex to sum into a single headline don't qualify. (unfortunately this would probably disqualify Kavanaugh or the immigrant caravan) Entries should be formatted thusly:

Respond in a root comment. The first line of your response should be the article (or video, etc) **title**, hotlinked to the original. I'll provide one nomination to use as a template.

"I am finishing up the audiobook of [Civilian Warriors: The Inside Story of Blackwater](https://www.audible.com/pd/Civilian-Warriors-Audiobook/B00GR5BDYY?ref=a_lib_c4_libItem_0_B00GR5BDYY&pf_rd_p=ae76b2bb-e63d-4a67-b357-dab3dee05ca1&pf_rd_r=MB29VT4ZRQS9NSM9J998&) and the Unsung Heroes of the War on Terror, and have found it an intriguing and fairly compelling perspective on the much demonized private military industry.

I want to recap the main arguments of the book here, but I have to throw the massive caveat up front that it was written by Erik Prince, the Founder and Ex-CEO of Blackwater, the most notorious private military contractor in America. The book is explicitly framed as a defense of both Blackwater’s conduct and the industry as a whole, so of course, we should approach all of Prince’s arguments skeptically.

For the sake of organization, I’ll write my summary in the form of a theoretical Q&A:

&#x200B;

**1. What is a Private Military Company?**

Private Military Companies (PMCs) are privately-owned, for-profit companies that provide manpower and advice for security operations.

For instance, Blackwater started out as a training complex in Virginia which trained police and military personnel, with a particular emphasis on special forces tactics. Early on, most of its customers were police forces looking to upgrade their training and US special forces who are obligated to be training during any stretch of time they aren’t in the field or on break.

With the outbreak of the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars, Blackwater shifted its focus to US Department of Defense and Department of State contracts, but also provided services to private companies, usually in the resource sector (though they also filled a contract for Disney to provide security advice on filming locations).

&#x200B;

**2. Isn’t “Private Military Company” a corporate euphemism for “Mercenaries”?**

No. Eric Prince is quite emphatic about this.

PMCs like Blackwater do not fulfill the [technical definition of a “mercenary” under the UN’s international law.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mercenary_Convention#Definition_of_a_mercenary) Which is good because mercenaries are illegal and don’t receive protection from the Geneva Convention.

There are two key distinctions.

First, “mercenaries” are individuals recruited from foreign countries to fight in a domestic conflict for pay. All of Blackwater’s combat personnel were always American.

Second, and IMO a bit more tenuously, PMCs like Blackwater don’t fight America’s wars in a traditional military sense. They never send soldiers to invade territory, assault bases, or assassinate key targets. They merely provide security for American personnel.

&#x200B;

**3. So what exactly do PMCs do?**

Discounting the training done back at its home base, PMCs like Blackwater generally have two jobs:

First, they do boring grunt work on military bases, like cooking, cleaning, and laundry. By doing this work, the PMCs free up military manpower for less mundane uses. If you’re wondering why the US military needs to pay actual soldiers (many of whom are ex-special forces) to cook and clean rather than just hire regular cooks and janitors for $10 per hour (plus hazard pay), it’s because there is a federal law that all private contractors working on US military bases in war zones must be combat trained (EDIT - I think it's more complicated than this, but I forget the exact parameters of the regulations).

Second, PMCs guard things – bases, trucks, supply depots, and especially VIPs. This is Blackwater’s specialty. The company first rose to fame when it provided security for Paul Bremer, the head of the provisional administration installed in Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. For 11 months, Bremer was the most targeted American government personnel on earth, and Blackwater protected him the entire time.

&#x200B;

**4. The US military is the most powerful force in all of human history, so why does it need PMCs?**

Prince gives four main reasons:

First, the US military is facing historic manpower shortages. Even with bonuses paid to new recruits, they simply no longer have the military to cover all their operations, especially while stretched out in two war zones in the 2000s. PMCs provide extra manpower.

**EDIT - Just to throw some numbers in here, for most of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, about 50% of US manpower was PMC. In the later stages of the war, it rose to as high as 75%.** [**Source.**](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/08/iraq-afghanistan-contractor-pentagon-obama/495731/)

Second, PMCs like Blackwater can go places the US military can’t. I mean that legally, bureaucratically, and sometimes physically.

For instance, whenever a US president says, “I pledge that America will deploy no more than X number of troops to Y war zone,” that X number doesn’t include private contractors. So if the Department of Defense thinks the civilian leadership is being too timid with its troop allotment, they can buy some PMCs.

PMCs are also not bound by many of the same restrictions that government agencies are. For example, during the planning of the invasion of Afghanistan, the CIA was supposed to scout out bombing targets in the country. The CIA had a local “governor” (AKA warlord) in mind to get info from, since he had had friendly relations with Americans in the past. The problem was that the CIA had been under a lot of scrutiny recently for dealing with shady characters, and this particular governor happened to be a heroin smuggler. The bigger problem was that every powerful person in Afghanistan was a shady character. If a guy wasn’t smuggling heroin, he was probably smuggling children, or taking bribes, or giving bribes, or selling weapons to Iran, or whatever.

So the CIA couldn’t talk to this governor… but Blackwater could. The CIA asked Blackwater to make inquiries, and Blackwater took out its rolodex and found an American oil businessman who had dealt with the governor in the past, and an information chain was established. The CIA got the intel, delivered it to the military, and the right targets were bombed.

There are many more examples recounted in the book, but I’ll stop with those for now.

Third, according to Prince, PMCs like Blackwater are simply more efficient than the US military, at least on a small scale. PMCs deploy faster and in greater variability, than the US military typically can.

Erik Prince is a Christian conservative who loves the US military. He thinks it’s awesome and defends freedom around the world. But he also thinks it has its weaknesses. It’s too big, too unwieldy, and lacks the profit motive to respond to fast changes. Prince doesn’t want to replace the US military with PMCs, but he sees PMCs as a crucial component of the United States’ entire military apparatus.

Let’s say a CIA director wants to do some shady shit in a remote province in Afghanistan, so it wants to set up a base there. It knows that it’s a dangerous place, so it needs soldiers to guard the base.

The CIA director *could* try to get the US army to guard the base, but that’s a massive hassle. As awesome as the army is at blowing things up, it is still a colossal bureaucracy packed to the brim with command chains and officers, and is overseen by civilians. Just to get a small squad of soldiers, the CIA director will have to go through some intergovernmental communication channels, and convince some general to send men, but that general won’t want to because he has nothing to be gained from doing it, and he’s worried that the Congressional Armed Services Committee will ask questions, and so on.

Or the CIA director could pick up the phone and call Blackwater. The Blackwater secretary will connect the director with Erik Prince, the CEO of Blackwater, who has no board of directors and no shareholders. Within three days, Blackwater will ship a squad of ex-navy Seals out to Bumfuck, Afghanistan, and the CIA director will be happy.

Fourth, and this is the one that I think is the most tenuous, the US military isn’t very good at guarding things. For whatever reason, security training is not prioritized and the US lacks military personnel with that specialty. So they rely on PMCs like Blackwater to take the toughest security jobs.

&#x200B;

**5. Who works for PMCs?**

Almost all of Blackwater’s personnel were ex-military, and a significant portion (the majority?) were ex-special forces. Prince himself was an ex-Navy Seal, so Blackwater had especially many Seals.

It’s worth noting that Blackwater never had an “army.” There were no guys in Blackwater logoed body armor sitting in military barracks in Virginia waiting to be deployed to war zones. Rather, PMCs typically act more like middlemen between contracts and soldiers. If the CIA needs 10 soldiers to guard a base, Blackwater will apply for the contract, and if it wins, it will post a request for 10 soldiers on its company bulletin, and then individually negotiate with anyone who steps forward. Given Blackwater’s history of training military and spec ops personnel, it had a deep roster.

&#x200B;

**6. How do private military contracts work?**

According to Prince, most PMCs use an idiotic “cost-plus” model. Basically, the government says it needs a job to be done, and the PMC pledges to do the job as long as the government pays it a certain percentage over its total costs (15% is the standard). Many of these types of contracts are secured in “no-bid” arrangements because either (charitably) the contract is time sensitive and they don’t have the luxury of going through a bidding process, or (uncharitably) because of shady backroom deals.

Blackwater preferred contracts where they were paid a lump sum up front, and it was the PMCs responsibility to spend less on the contract than they earned (typically hitting a 10% margin). Critics claimed that this model would encourage companies to cut corners, but as a libertarian capitalist, Prince argues that reputation penalties were enough of a deterrent, especially since there is a federal regulation that any government contract provider can indefinitely blacklist a contractor at their discretion.

&#x200B;

**7. How much money do PMC troops make?**

Between $450-600 per day, depending on the nature of the contract and the soldier’s experience. Plus they get bonuses for holidays and contract completion, usually around $3,000-5,000.

&#x200B;

**8. Isn’t that absurdly expensive for the US government compared to regular US military soldiers?**

According to Prince, when you factor in taxes and benefits, PMCs typically cost taxpayers no more than regular soldiers.

It’s true that PMCs make far more in pure cash than US military personnel, ~~but the latter doesn’t pay income taxes~~ (EDIT - US soldiers usually pay taxes, but given that most of their remuneration is non-monetary, they pay far less than PMCs), gets full medical benefits for their entire families, and gets access to a massive array of military-based social programs, including free college. PMC troops pay taxes and get no benefits whatsoever.

&#x200B;

**9. So why would anyone want to be a PMC? Why not just serve in the US military?**

Flexibility. US military service has mandated service times which typically stretch for years. PMC troops sign up for individual contracts, which typically last 3-12 months. Plus PMCs often get better equipment and nicer facilities.

&#x200B;

**10. Are PMCs a new thing?**

Prince has a… creative understanding of military history. If you ask Prince, PMCs are in the very DNA of America.

Who discovered America? The private maritime contractor, Christopher Columbus, hired by the Spanish monarchy.

Who established America’s first settlement? The private military contractor, John Smith (of Pocahontas fame), who was hired by the Virginia company to bring law to the Jamestown colony and make it run profitably, which he did.

How did American win its independence? With the assistance, of private military contractors from Europe, like the Marquis de Lafayette.

Where did the US Secret Service come from? It was created by the Pinkerton security company at the behest of President Lincoln.

You can find similar examples in the Spanish American War, World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War, and everything in-between up to the present day. PMCs are nothing new, they have always been a part of American history.

&#x200B;

**11. Why does everyone hate PMCs and especially Blackwater?**

I wish Prince had addressed this question more directly. He spends a lot of the book discussing particular events where Blackwater was criticized, most notably the [Nisour Square Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisour_Square_massacre), and giving his perspective on events, but he never attempts to summarize why PMCs have such a bad reputation. But from the book, I got a few big reasons.

First, there is simply a *disgust* factor when it comes to PMCs. Most people associate companies like Blackwater with shady, bearded, muscle-bound, war-hardened mercenaries who profit off the misery of war. These are supposed guys who have no qualms about killing for cash. They run from war to war racking up body counts and laughing their way to the bank. They are dregs of society given license to brutalize. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter how many charts and graphs you can put up to show the efficiency of PMCs, many people are simply disgusted by the sheer concept.

Prince could not see Blackwater more differently. Prince is a Roman Catholic conservative libertarian (he attended Hillsdale College) who believes in the goodness of the American government, and especially its military. He saw the formation of Blackwater as a patriotic act that helps America keep itself and the world safe. Yes, he made a lot of money, but that doesn’t mean he can’t be sincere in his beliefs.

Second, and relatedly, PMCs are an easy scapegoat and political punching bag.

You simply cannot insult the military in America. Or at least you can’t if you want to become or remain an elected official. The military is sacrosanct. On the right it’s divine, on the left it’s at least taboo to criticize. Either way, no politician at any level of government can stand up and say things like, “American troops are brutal thugs,” or “the US military is incompetent,” or the “American soldiers are out of control.”

But they can say all those things about PMCs.

Basically, Prince argues that Blackwater was constantly excoriated for doing things that the US military did all the time, but because Blackwater is a heartless PMC and not the beloved military, it received universal scorn rather than sympathetic understandings about the harsh realities of war.

Yes, Blackwater troops messed up sometimes. One time a Blackwater supply plane crashed because the pilots were being dumb. One time a Blackwater soldier got drunk and walked off-base with his gun. On quite a few occasions, Blackwater personnel shot civilians who they erroneously perceived to be threats.

These are all unfortunate events, but this is what happens in war. Everyone understands this when it comes to the US military and offers understanding. But PMCs get labeled as sociopathic cowboys for the same mishaps.

In the Nisour Square Massacre, Prince argues that his soldiers did absolutely nothing wrong, and followed military protocol to the letter. Yet, many of the soldiers were convicted, and the event led to massively increased regulations on PMCs, because the US government sacrificed Blackwater as a bargaining chip to appease the Iraqi government in a political negotiation.

With such rampant anti-PMC sentiments, inaccuracies and myths about PMCs have become commonplace. People think PMCs are mercenaries, but they’re not. People think that PMCs cost far more than US military soldiers, but they don’t. People think PMCs drain US military manpower, but they do the opposite. People think PMC soldiers operate under no rules of engagement, but they do (they don’t use the standard Department of Defense procedures, but they are bound by the local consulate rules).

&#x200B;

**12. What happened to Blackwater and Erik Prince?**

Blackwater is still around, but it was renamed Blackwater Global, and then Xe Services, and now it’s Academi, and I hope they still have some more cool names in reserve.

Erik Prince stepped down from the CEO position in 2009. If you have heard his name since then, it’s probably because his sister is ~~Nancy~~  Betsy DeVos.

The so-called Talmud Bankruptcy Problem -- ~2000 years old -- covers the process for dividing the estate of a man who dies owing more money than he has, owing different amounts to different creditors. In typical fashion, the Talmud gives a few examples and leaves the reader to infer a general rule. It's a ""problem"" because the examples seem inconsistent. No one had a good hypothesis for the general rule -- to the point where some thought the best explanation was simply a transcription error.

Abstract: 

>This paper analyzes the determinants behind the spatial distribution of the LGBT population in the U.S. We relate the size of the present-day LGBT population to the discovery of gold mines during the 19th century gold rushes. Comparing the surroundings of these gold mines to other current and former mining counties, we find that there are currently 10-15% more same-sex couples in counties in which gold discoveries were made during the gold rushes. We also provide empirical evidence that residents of gold rush counties still have more favorable attitudes toward homosexuality nowadays. Our findings are consistent with two mechanisms. First, gold rushes led to a large (temporary) increase in the male-to-female ratio. Second, we show that gold rush counties were less likely to house a notable place of worship at the time of the discovery (and in the following decades) and are currently less religious, suggesting a role of institutions in shaping attitudes and norms.

"    Priority interrupt: Syntactic language use detected. Resume? Y/N/R/Q

Imagine that you're running a simulation of an island chain. It's pretty well-realized; ocean and wind currents are well-modeled, but so too are the plate tectonics that are perpetually giving rise to new islands. The ecology of the islands is vibrant and complex, ranging from thriving coral reefs and shoals of fish to endless profusions of terrestrial plants and animals. And best of all, a pseudo-sapient race of vaguely-humanoid natives that you like to think of as 'Archipeligans'.

One day you decide to slow down the sim speed and zoom in on these critters. Much to your delight, they seem to have developed some kind of language and are engaged in what looks like a council! You're able to run time forward and backward, of course, and with the help of some trusty scripts you're soon able to work out that their language is quite rudimentary -- only ninety-six words so far -- and that they're debating the merits of building small watercraft and moving to the next island over, which they can see is full of plentiful fruit trees.

Your eyes dart to another window -- this one an overlay of tectonic activity -- and you wince. The Archipeligans aren't *real*, of course, but you're fond of the little guys. You pause the sim and set to work.

It takes all afternoon, but before long you're ready to set your plan in motion. You unpause the sim, fire up your new script, and watch with pleasure as a glowing, golden orb appears in the midst of the Archipeligan council. Conversation ceases and all heads turn toward your avatar.

But what to say? The Archipeligans' language has no generic word for 'danger' at all, let alone 'vulcanism'. You're going to have to get the message across in words they can understand.

""No go there,"" throbs the orb. ""Killjaws there.""

The Archipeligans recoil in gratifying terror. The 'killjaws', as they'd have it, are their most fearsome natural predator. This should be sufficient to curb their ill-fated expansion plans. The fact that there aren't actually any killjaws on that island is inconvenient, but it's not really a *lie*. It's just the closest to the truth you can get in their almost painfully-limited language.

Satisfied that you've done your good turn for the day, you deactivate the glow-orb, switch off the lights, and head for bed.

* * *

In the days of the Fathers, the Light walked among them and spoke words of warning. 'Killjaws there', it said. Some believed and gave up their plans. But others, envious of the plentiful fruit on that island, built their watercraft anyway and loitered just off-shore. They were sensible, these Testers, and took their time, slowly circumnavigating and observing the new island without ever making landfall.

And -- the Light's words notwithstanding -- *there were no killjaws there!* Only a glorious abundance of streaming freshwater and glistening fruit, bursting in its ripeness.

Some of the Archipeligans didn't care. The Light had said there were killjaws there, and so they were sure there must be, observation be damned. The Testers laughed and scorned them, and called them Believers. But the Believers were soon forgotten as the majority of the Archipeligans set off for their new land of plenty.

For a time all seemed well. A few generations passed. The descendants of the Testers thrived and grew in number, while the obstinate Believers scraped for sustenance in misery. But they could look across the waters and see the Testers' children growing tall and strong and proud, and their own sons and daughters crossed the water in the night in dismaying numbers. No one *seemed* to be falling prey to killjaws, after all.

And then, one day, a terrible earth-shake struck the new island. Settlements were laid waste and the death toll was staggering. But when it was done it was done, and for the Testers life went on as it ever had. They weren't troubled by thoughts of the Light; it had warned about killjaws, after all, not earth-shakes. They took the apparent instability of the new island into account and rebuilt. Before long they were thriving again, and their progeny covered all of the new island except its highest peaks.

Back on the original island, the Believers were in schism. They all venerated the Light, of course; those that didn't were long-gone. But many of them now believed that they knew what the Light had *really* been telling them. No, there were no killjaws, but there were terrible earth-shakes -- a concept unknown in the days of the Fathers. And the Testers had developed new building designs to withstand such things! So now, these Interpreters insisted, everyone could move to the new island and live in full-bellied bliss, even as they respected the now-explicable warnings of the Light.

'Not so', bleated the remaining Believers. 'There are killjaws there.'

The Interpreters shook their heads sadly -- the question of killjaws had, after all, been long-settled -- and sadly did the Believers watch as almost all of their sons and daughters sailed off for the new island.

Yet even as they arrived, the highest peaks began to smoke...

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of December 10, 2018

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/slatestarcodex's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.

This impressed Eliezer Yudkowsky so much that [he made a bet with Bryan that the world would be destroyed by AGI before 2030](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2017/01/my_end-of-the-w.html), partly because Yudkowsky thought (somewhat facetiously) this might *causally* reduce the probability of this happening.

[Caplan believes his record indicates he has superior knowledge and judgment](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2017/06/what_a_bet_show.html). Is that reasonable?

My thoughts are that it’s an indicator of good judgment, but not an overly strong one. It’s roughly the equivalent of being an overall winner after a few hundred hands of poker. That’s (weakly) positively correlated with poker ability, but it’s a small sample size, and could have been influenced by being able to select a game with many weak “fish” players. (Similarly, some commentators has suggested that a lot of Caplan’s success is being able to arrange bets with people who say overconfident things and accept his relatively small bets to avoid losing face).

Furthermore, I'd posit that Caplan's bets are not completely independent, given that he generally takes the side of ""things are going to regress to the medium-term mean"". Perhaps this works well on average, but maybe in the worlds where Caplan loses, it's often because of a tail risk that causes him to lose most of his bets. 

I’d be a lot more impressed if Caplan scored highly in forecasting tournaments, made a lot of money in prediction markets, or made around a hundred predictions a year [like Scott does](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/02/06/predictions-for-2018/).

"Apropos of Scott's recent review of Evolutionary Psychology, this [paper](https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/13/10/1081/5114640) suggests (although N~100) which suggests that having a rough childhood is correlated with lower gray matter volume in prefrontal areas association with inhibition. This seems like almost too-perfect manifestation of del Giudice's theory -- the quality of ones childhood very literally models the brain towards a fast or slow strategy.

Also, to sneak in some meta-science here, it's interesting that in this light, the scientists from Team Slow identify lesser control as impairment whereas they identify the non-childhood-adversity result as normal. That seems a bit cheeky, at least my gut is that most of the world (now and historically) is closer to 'adverse childhood' than a control group from UM and UIC.

"**TLDR**: Charity slows macroeconomic growth, which harms many  more people in the future than it helps now.

The argument:

**1.** Economic development has generated more human comfort and well-being than any other factor in history, and by a wide margin at that. As Tyler Cowen observes:

>Imagine our ancestors sitting around, say, a thousand years ago, saying they didn’t care very much about us. And they were willing to accept a growth rate, say, a percentage point lower than what has been the case for the last thousand years. We would all, right now, be in extreme poverty. We would be suffering. Life expectancy would probably be something like 40 years of age. We wouldn’t have created a lot of artistic and cultural wonders. So there’s a plurality of values that’s supported by economic growth. And that’s the most fundamental thing we should be willing to endorse at a macro level.

**2.** From an EA perspective, there's no reason to morally value future humans less than current humans, any more than there's a reason to value Africans less than Americans. Proximity in time shouldn't effect moral worth any more than proximity in space does. There's a potential argument to be had about discount rates here, but at a minimum I think it's an idea that has to be grappled with.

**3.** Given the compounding nature of economic growth, any misallocation today will have exponentially larger effects going forward. If it's sound advice for young people to defer consumption today in favor of higher future returns, shouldn't that logic also apply to an EA'er looking to do maximum good?

**4.** Charity harms macroeconomic growth. This is the most uncertain point, as I wasn't able to find any good data on it, but it certainly seems plausible. I can make some plausibility arguments below if anyone wants to discuss. 

**5.** At the very least, if an EA'er wants to argue for a present-day transfer, he should be compelled to justify the argument in terms of it helping long-term growth. E.g., the only possible rational basis for an EA'ers behavior is to act so as to maximize economic growth. That's the only core value that makes sense. EA can be effectively reframed as a pure economics. Drop the emotional language of 'charity' and 'suffering' and just talk about economic development.

"A note for the mods: this post touches on genetics and intelligence but focuses on individual differences not HBD so I thought it would be fine to post out of the culture war thread


We can divide High-IQ people into 2 groups that I will call expected intellects and prodigies. An expected intellect is someone who has an IQ that is high for the general population but is within the expected range given the IQs of their recent ancestors. A prodigy is someone who's IQ is anomalously high given the IQs of their recent ancestors. So for example someone with an IQ of 140 might be an expected intellect if their parents and grandparents were all academics but would be a prodigy if their parents were of average intelligence.


My hypothesis is that prodigies will be more likely to experience mental health issues. I can very informally motivate thus through an analogy. An expected intelligence is like a fancy sports car whereas a prodigy is like an old beater with a rocket strapped to the back. They might have the same top speed but one of them is probably more prone to crashing. A more scientific motivation goes like there are likely certain genes or combinations of genes that do not directly influence intelligence but do help the brain more easily adapt to running at a high intelligence. If someones genetic lineage has been high IQ for multiple generations they have likely experienced significantly stronger selection in favor of these genes so they are likely to be healthier given high IQ. This mechanism requires that genes which support mental health have varying efficacies in people at different IQ levels which isn't given but seems plausible.


Now without data this can only be a hypothesis so does anyone know if differences between the 2 groups I defined have ever been studied? If not does anyone have access to a dataset from which they could be studied? (For a single generation analysis the dataset would need subjects IQ, both parents IQs and some personality and mental health variables).


This is a bit of a pet theory of mine as it explains my own situation quite well. This means I might be biased so critiques are welcome. I am what I would call a double prodigy. My grandparents were mostly uneducated laborers (very rough estimated IQ ~100) my parents are educated professionals (estimated IQ 120-130) and I am a math olympiad winner (estimated IQ 150+) and I have struggled a lot with depression, anxiety and suspected aspergers and I'm always looking for a reason why I struggle so much when my life situation seems superficially enviable.",A Hypothesis on Intelligence,a45oo2,new,25,10,10,0

[Blogpost](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-grand-games-chess-shogi-and-go/)

> AlphaZero replaces the handcrafted knowledge and domain-specific augmentations used in traditional game-playing programs with deep neural networks, a general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithm, and a general-purpose tree search algorithm.

.

> We trained separate instances of AlphaZero for chess, shogi, and Go. Training proceeded for 700,000 steps (in mini-batches of 4096 training positions) starting from randomly initialized parameters. During training only, 5000 first-generation tensor processing units (TPUs) (19) were used to generate self-play games, and 16 second-generation TPUs were used to train the neural networks. Training lasted for approximately 9 hours in chess, 12 hours in shogi, and 13 days in Go 

There has been some criticism of the initial chess games between AlphaZero and Stockfish 8, criticisms addressed in this paper.

> We evaluated the fully trained instances of AlphaZero against Stockfish, Elmo, and the previous version of AlphaGo Zero in chess, shogi, and Go, respectively. Each program was run on the hardware for which it was designed (23): Stockfish and Elmo used 44 central processing unit (CPU) cores (as in the TCEC world championship), whereas AlphaZero and AlphaGo Zero used a single machine with four first-generation TPUs and 44 CPU cores (24). The chess match was played against the 2016 TCEC (season 9) world champion Stockfish [see (10) for details]. The shogi match was played against the 2017 CSA world champion version of Elmo (10). The Go match was played against the previously published version of AlphaGo Zero [also trained for 700,000 steps (25)]. All matches were played by using time controls of 3 hours per game, plus an additional 15 s for each move.
> 
> In Go, AlphaZero defeated AlphaGo Zero (9), winning 61% of games. This demonstrates that a general approach can recover the performance of an algorithm that exploited board symmetries to generate eight times as much data (see fig. S1).
> 
> In chess, AlphaZero defeated Stockfish, winning 155 games and losing 6 games out of 1000 

Even more

> To verify the robustness of AlphaZero, we played additional matches that started from common human openings (Fig. 3). AlphaZero defeated Stockfish in each opening, suggesting that AlphaZero has mastered a wide spectrum of chess play. The frequency plots in Fig. 3 and the time line in fig. S2 show that common human openings were independently discovered and played frequently by AlphaZero during self-play training. We also played a match that started from the set of opening positions used in the 2016 TCEC world championship; AlphaZero won convincingly in this match, too (26) (fig. S4). We played additional matches against the most recent development version of Stockfish (27) and a variant of Stockfish that uses a strong opening book (28). AlphaZero won all matches by a large margin (Fig. 2).

"  

This is an attempt to coalesce some ideas which have been floating around my mind for over a decade. Basically, I see two dominant relationship models in the modern world, and I think people struggle to decide which one is right for them. 

For the sake of efficiency, I’ll write my descriptions of the two models from a male perspective. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Model 1 – The Fairy Tale Model (FTM)

I am a cluster of mostly biologically-determined traits that make up my personality. My personality will slowly morph over time, especially in my adolescence, but eventually it will harden, and I will mostly be who I am for the rest of my life.

My romantic goal is to find the most compatible woman on a single metric – Romantic Compatibility.

What is Romantic Compatibility? It’s an aggregation of many factors, including sexual attraction, emotional reciprocity, acceptance, mutual growth, common passions, etc, that all get rolled into one magical ball. By its very nature, Romantic Compatibility *cannot* be fully disaggregated. You know it when you feel it. You can have the thought in your mind “what if I spend the next 50 years married to this woman?” and your gut reaction to that will be a decent test of her Romantic Compatibility.

This metric is highly abstract and intangible, and can only be discovered through trial-and-error and introspection. Basically, every woman on earth has a magical number in her soul, on a scale of 1-10, which corresponds to her romantic compatibility with me. Given that my personality changes over time due to environmental factors, these numbers will also shift over time, but likely within a limited range.

Discovering a woman’s number is not easy. It takes prolonged exposure in the form of friendship and dating, but with enough time you can map a woman’s personality, compare it with yours, and make a general guess at the number. For instance, you might conclude that you and a girl could never happily date, or your relationship would be a short-term fling, or you might get bored of her after a few months, or you could see yourself spending the rest of your life with her.

Under this model, your dating strategy should be to date a succession of women throughout your life, keep track of their Romantic Compatibility rating, gain a better sense of what you’re looking for, and search for that in women until you find the highest possible rating.

The challenge here is that you’re operating under the constraint of time. The longer you wait to settle down, the more information you’ll have about your Romantic Compatibility target, but the fewer options you’ll have as more women get married and become unavailable. 

So basically, you have to decide on a Romantic Compatibility rating that is acceptable to you, and find a woman in the population who passes that level. If you pick too high a number, there will be too few eligible women, and you risk being alone forever. If you pick too low a number, you will end up with someone unsatisfying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Model 2 – The Min-Max Model (3M)

All people are nothing more than a collection of traits. Your romantic goal should be to find the woman who has the highest possible rating on the relevant traits within the constraints offered by your own ratings.

The relevant metrics vary by individual in rank order, but for basically all men, what really matters is attractiveness, sexual ability, status, emotional reflection, shared long-term career/family goals, and shared hobbies/passions.

Under the 3M model, you accept that Romantic Compatibility is a myth. There is no special feeling of being with “the one.” You just have to find a person who is good enough in the relative criteria.

One advantage here is that you can mix and match the criteria to be more flexible. You should be willing to put up with dating a girl with whom you share no hobbies if she’s hot enough. Or you might want to accept a lower status girl if she wants the same exact family life as you.

The optimization challenge with the 3M model is that you are more of a moving target. Your ability to get a hot, high status, interesting woman if restricted by how hot, high status, and interesting you are. But fortunately, you have much more control over that than you do your inherent personality. As you get older, you can take care of your physical health, make more money, and read more books. You can make yourself the type of guy who attracts beautiful women working in finance rather than settling for middling women working in retail.

However, this model creates a much more competitive dating market by virtue of its fluidity. Under the 3M model, you would date any woman on earth who has a high enough ranking in the relative metrics, and “high enough” is likely equal to or greater than your own rankings, so unless you‘re Elon Musk, that means there are tens of millions of women in the world you would happily settle for. But that’s true of all men, and thus you must fight against them.

Therefore, your strategy should be to boost your own ratings until a point when you will face a natural decline due to age. Unless your wealth increases enormously, your constraints are going to get tighter after your 30s, so you should try to find a maximized woman within your prime.

"I may make a full article exploring isolation and the trend of these behaviors in society soon but for now, here is a short bit. I’m curious how many relate and what you think about this. 

The evolution of social withdrawal:

Your baseline sense of comfort is decreased with time spent isolated. Level of comfort is involved in your willingness to face conflict. Level of comfort also determines expectation of negative events, neuroticism essentially. That may be due to frequency of negative experience increasing as baseline level of comfort is low from isolation. An increase in expectation of social conflict occurs for various reasons, such as people being upset that you haven’t talked to them, and also any reason that may have sparked the initial avoidance and isolation. The level of conflict you can handle decreases because the level of baseline comfort is decreased. It means universal ability to cope with negative experience is decreased. Eventually you are unwilling to face even the most minor conflicts because you will overreact, resulting in isolation as a choice. 

Another factor is we often cope by social means. We get advice, relate on sufferings, and contagiously adopt other people’s ideas and moods. This can prevent rumination traps. 

Now I’m curious about whether genes involved in many mental health problems such as depression are less about a chemical imbalance of sorts and more to do with chemicals altering behavioral tendencies in relation to groups, in a way that these people are prone to naturally fall down a path of isolation such as this. 

I have explored this a bit before in one of my posts, where exploratory types would be likely to suffer this by being more divergent and non-tribal enough.

"I wonder if certain personality types or temperaments (or whatever concept adequately accounts for the different styles of thinking people employ) have a tendency to enjoy different types of puzzles. And by puzzle I just mean an intellectual challenge undertaken for fun. This is more of an autobiographical post. I'm curious how others think about this. 

Let me give a little background. I realized recently that I hate crossword puzzles. And though I've enjoyed the odd riddle on occasion, I don't really like thinking about riddles. 

This is a bit surprising to me, since I'm a fairly verbally-oriented person. I have a large vocabulary, speak/read multiple languages, enjoy witty comedy and word-play, etc. So why would I rather solve chess problems or sudoku-style puzzles than these more verbal forms? 

In reflecting on this, I came to the conclusion that for me, the appeal of a puzzle lies precisely in the figuring out, in the working through. To engage in the attempt, I need confidence that the answer is both 1) objective and 2) deducible from given information. Deducibility is what separates a puzzle from a trivia question. 

These criteria seem to put riddles on very shaky ground. The presumption of a riddle is that a clever person, provided with a certain clue, ought to reach a certain conclusion. Thus, all riddles seem to come down to not quite Bilbo Baggins' ""What's in my pocket?"" but rather ""What's in my brain?"" Solving them means replicating some other person's thought process. More than that, it means affirming that thought process. Riddles force the solver to proceed on the assumption that the clue is valid, when it's not possible to judge the validity of the clue before knowing the answer. The legitimacy of riddles of any non-trivial difficulty would seem to be undermined both by the plurality of cultures and by any differences in thinking style among humans.  

Crossword puzzles are in some ways worse. The clues are very short riddles that scale difficulty either 1) by doubling down on objectivity but compensating by being very obscure, so they basically become tests of very particular knowledge or 2) by sacrificing deducibility and being rather open-ended. If you don't get the answer to a crossword clue fairly quickly or get lucky based on other filled in letters, it seems unlikely that further disciplined thinking is going to help you. You end up just looking up the answer, which absolutely kills the puzzle for me. 

To be clear, I'm not judging anyone who likes these things or finds them fun. I'm just trying to explain why they feel lacking to me *as puzzles*. They don't satisfy that puzzle itch. And I'm curious whether other people have had thoughts along the same lines, and whether you think that has anything to do with personality or thinking style or whatnot.

>Description: This paper applies improved household income data to reevaluate the levels, trends, composition, and role of social policy in extreme child poverty in the U.S. from 1997-2015. Unlike prior research, we correct for the underreporting of means-tested transfers and incorporate the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). Doing so reduces the share of children below $2 per day from about 1.8% to 0.1%. That said, we acknowledge use of survey data omits the estimated 1.3 million homeless children in 2014-2015. We find that three different measures of extreme child poverty have declined since 1997. Unlike prior literature’s focus on single motherhood, citizenship status is the more consequential characteristic. Between 58-73% of children in extreme poverty live in households headed by non-citizens. Simulations granting them access to the median SNAP benefit reduce their extreme poverty substantially. Two-way fixed effects models show that higher state-level generosity and take up of SNAP and TANF significantly reduce extreme poverty. Unlike prior research’s focus on the decline of TANF, we show SNAP has grown in generosity and take-up. In turn, changes to social policy since 1997 have probably had offsetting effects on extreme child poverty.

"We've all heard of stories from people who won a multi-million lottery and had their lives absolutely destroyed. I recently read an article about Jack Whittaker, a nice-hearted millionaire from West Virginia with a nice business, a loving wife and a wholesome granddaughter, who won a $300+ million jackpot. Two years later, his wife had divorced him, he was arrested several times for driving under the influence, his granddaughter went from a nice country girl to Lindsay Lohan on steroids and was found dead wrapped in a tarp in a garbage can after overdosing on cocaine. Jack (the lottery winner) ended up going to bars and offering random women $10,000 to strip for him. The story is [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/24/jack-whittaker-powerball-lottery-winners-life-was-ruined-after-m-jackpot/) for those with 20 minutes to burn 

Now obviously one story does not a statistic make, but it is not a secret that lottery winners have exponentially more chances to end up badly than average people. One site says that a [whopping 44% of lottery winners end up with less than what they had before winning the lottery after 5 years](https://www.thelotter.ca/shocking-lottery-stats/). Another site says that on average, [70% of all lottery winners end up declaring bankrupcy at one point in their lives](https://brandongaille.com/22-lottery-winners-bankrupt-statistics/). I found it surprisingly hard to find the likelihood that an average American will declare bankruptcy within their lifetime for comparison, but I could find that the average bankruptcy rate in the US is 200 per 100,000; that is 600,000 per 300 million inhabitants, or just 0.2% of people go bankrupt each year. Extrapolate this value to a working life of 30 years and you get 6%. This is by no means a perfect or even accurate value, but it is simply to show how much more likely people who win the lottery are from normal people.

The chances of winning the lottery are astonishingly small. Most rational people make the case that even though economically it is not a sound investment, it is worth it for the dreams and hopes that having a lottery ticket in your wallet gives you. I can definitely empathise with that. However, we can make the case that about half of people who win the lottery end up worse than they were before. And it does NOT follow that the other half of people have blissfully idyllic lives, only that their lives will not become worse by winning the lottery. So by buying a lottery ticket you are hoping that you will not only guess a one in a 300 million ticket, but that you will be among the 50% of people whose lives were improved by the win. You could just as easily be in the other 50% and have your life be utterly destroyed.

Even if you were somehow able to predict the lottery numbers in advance, you would basically be flipping a coin whether your life becomes significantly better or significantly worse. If a genie came down from heaven and offered you a chance to flip this coin right now, I doubt you would take it; in fact, very few people would. Then why are we willing to pay money for an infinitesimal chance of having this choice imposed on us? One could even make the case that buying a lottery ticket has *negative* utility, and thus it is an immoral thing to do. 

One counterargument to this is the obvious ""well I'm smart, not like *those* people, I would know perfectly well what to do with the money"". The problem with this is that [everybody thinks exactly that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias). I do not buy that argument for one second, unless you happen to be an investment banker at Goldman Sachs or if you have extensive experience managing your multi-million family fortune. Nobody here for sure would know what to do if they suddenly got tens of millions of dollars handed to them, and although it is very tempting to imagine we would be the exception to the rule and that WE would know how to properly invest the money without destroying our lives in the process without any experience at all, it sure isn't likely. Jack Whittaker was already a millionaire when he won, and he had a business with 100 employees under him, he certainly wasn't a college student or an entry-level programmer like most people in this sub. Yet the money still corrupted him all the same.

Here is a post I made. I know this place is so obsessed with IQ that everyone here lists it.  So, quite relevant to interests here.

And thoughts?

**Introduction**

The [Mega test](http://miyaguchi.4sigma.org/hoeflin/mega.html) is a High IQ test created by [Ronald Hoeflin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_K._Hoeflin).    A high score on this exam guarantees entrance into several of the   numerous High-IQ societies across the world. These purport to be a good   deal more selective then the more well known Mensa Society, and Hoeflin   claims the test is harder then what is at post-grad at MIT. After all,   it is supposed to find the worlds smartest person.One in a   million…apparently only 300 people in America can possibly qualify for   the mega-society, and the only way to do so is by taking this test or   its numerous off-shoots, such as the [Titan Test](http://miyaguchi.4sigma.org/hoeflin/titan/titan.html), The [Power Test](http://miyaguchi.4sigma.org/hoeflin/power/power.html), and the [Ultra test](http://miyaguchi.4sigma.org/hoeflin/ultra/ultra.html).

Not  everyone in the world takes those seriously, but a \*lot\* of  people  do.   Scoring high on the exam has let several people posture to  the  American Public as being the smartest person in the Nation.  Several   people have acquired fame largely due to this test, with the most   famous being [Marilyn vos ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant)[Savant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_vos_Savant) and [Christopher Langan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Langan), with the runner up being [Rick Rosner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_G._Rosner).   Each of these individuals is commonly debated across the web and each   has had major television specials asking them about their genius.

Savant  ended up the writer of Ask Marilyn  in Parade Magazine, which was once  one of the most popular magazines in  America that commonly showed up in  peoples houses. The latest issue was  \*always\* in the doctors office.   She arrived at that position by her  listing in the Guinness Book of  World Records for highest IQ that was  supported by the Mega test.

Christopher  Langan, thanks to his high performance on the test and  having the  honors of having the highest score(on his second go around)  got the  lofty title of “Smartest Man in America”. He was a major feature  in [Malcolm Gladwells title “Outliers”](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930),   and Gladwell lamented that Langan’s financially poor upbringing did  not  prepare him for life.  He created the CTMU, what he calls the  Cognitive  Theoretic Model of the Universe, and he purports that in it  he is  closer to the deep secrets of reality then anyone else has ever  been.

I used to wonder exactly why there  were no big names in the Academic  world scoring high on these  contests.  Why were people like Terrence  Tao, someone considered the  greatest mathematician of the 21st century,  not showing their high  scores or attempting to answer these tests?  Why  were there not even  lesser known names such as “random” professors of  unis, major players  in tech industries, or writers and philosophers not  answering these  questions?  Was someone like Christopher Langan truly  some untouchable  brain?  He won the smartest person in the world test,  right?

Well  guess what. The test is a crock of bullshit, and no professional   mathematician would feel comfortable getting a high score on this as   bragging rights in a professional setting. If they did, they would be   seen as someone known as a charlatan by any other responsible   professionals in their field.  There is a good reason just why Langan’s   CTMU is commonly compared with the [Sokal Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair) , one of the most famous academic scandals of all time, by other professionals in his field.

So I decided to write a post putting in crystal clear reasoning just \*why\* this test is bad.

**The Test Itself**

Here  is a thought.  What if the GRE subject exams in physics or  mathematics  renamed themselves “The Super Duper Test”,  and said that  its  impossible to study for it? Since hey, its an IQ test?  Well…in that   case, any math major or physics major would be at an impossible huge   advantage, simply based on their training.

This  is what the test mostly is.  There is a lot of rebranded  introductory  questions(and I do mean intro questions, not questions  known to be  difficult at a high level) from college mathematics here. If  you know  beforehand these results then you are at an absolutely huge  advantage.  Some of the questions really require a course in lesser known  college  mathematics such as Group theory and Graph theory, and others  benefit  \*hugely\* from knowing how to program computer algorithms.   I  know  this…because when I looked at this test several years ago I did not   know how to solve them and gave up. After taking some mathematics   courses and programming courses, several of the questions are easy and   route.

Here are some examples.

* Problem 12 of the Power test  

   * This is a simple rewording of the [result found in the early 1800’s made by mathematician Steiner](http://www2.washjeff.edu/users/mwoltermann/Dorrie/67.pdf).  Here is the straight up comparison.
   * “Suppose  a cube of butter is sliced by five perfectly straight  (i.e., planar)  knife strokes, the pieces thereby formed never moving  from their  initial positions. What is the maximum number of pieces that  can  thereby be formed?”
   * “What is the maximum number of parts into which space can be divided by n planes”
   * All  you do for the exact same problem is just put the space you  slice into  a cube. Really.  This was an interesting math problem solved  hundreds  of years ago.
* Problems 29, 37-44 Ultra Test, 5-8 ,29-30 Power Test, 28-29 Titan Test  

   * Each  one of these involves the exact same theorem in Group Theory,  which is  Burnsides Lemma, or Polya’s Enumeration Theorem(which burnsides  lemma  is a specific case of)
   * “If  each side of a cube is painted red or blue or yellow, how many   distinct color patterns are possible?” is problem 8 on the Power test.
   * [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s\_lemma#Example\_application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma#Example_application)
   * You  really should go on the above link. These are the \*exact\* same   problem.  Every question I linked is just basically the same problem, or   a minor variation of the problem on like…a pyramid instead of a cube.   The lightbulb questions are the same as the coloring questions, just   have a lightbulb on/there be white and off/not there be black.
   * On the Ultra Test, you will gain over 10 IQ points for knowing this theorem.  WOO!
* Ant Problems 38-42 Titan Test, 21-24 power test  

   * Making  the ants form a giant path on the cube/other structure is an  example  of forming a Hamiltonian Cycle on a polyhedral graph. Results in  graph  theory and ways of approaching graph theory problems really help  this  one out.
   * [https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1596653/how-does-the-icosian-calculus-help-to-find-a-hamiltonian-cycle](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1596653/how-does-the-icosian-calculus-help-to-find-a-hamiltonian-cycle)
   * Taking a course in “Problem solving with Graph Theory” is thus very useful, and is what a math major might do.
   * Note  that you don’t absolutely need to use clever math on this to solve it.  The dodecahedron  has 3,486,784,401  different possible ant paths.  It  will take awhile, but not an  incredibly long time, to brute force the  solution with a stupid computer  programming solution.
* Problem 14 on the power test  

   * This is the same as this problem on brilliant.org
   * [https://brilliant.org/practice/number-bases-level-3-4-challenges/?p=3](https://brilliant.org/practice/number-bases-level-3-4-challenges/?p=3)
   * I’m  a level 5 on the site(bragging rights :D) but…note that this  question  is tricky when not taught to think in different types of number  bases,  but not an extremely hard question when taught to do so.  This  type of  thinking is common in big math clubs, like the type in New York  at  Stuyvesant high.
   * Note. **A  question that is on a test that is supposed to find  the \*smartest\*  person in the world…isn’t even a level 5 on a site with  plenty of level  5 people. Its a level 4.** 

These  are some of the worst examples on the test. I really could go  on  more,  but that’s just going to make this post drag on more then it   needs to be, and nobody knows how to read longer then a cracked.com post   anymore anyways.

So if its basically a  math test with some computer science thrown  in…why does it include  sections that mathematicians believe are  fundamentally invalid to  include in a test?

**Number Sequence Problems**

📷

Number  sequence problems. Finding the answer  to an arbitrary number sequence  given to one is known to be a fruitless  effort by actual, real,  professional mathematicians. Why so?  Because  its possible to create an  \*infinite\* amount of mathematical formulas  that generate any possible  sequence of numbers.

A simple example of  “wait, I thought the pattern was”  is this.  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,….you  think you know what it is right, and the entire  sequence? Each one  increases by 1?  Well wrong.    I took the Floor  Function of y =  1.1\*n.  (Take the first integer lower then the value)

Thus  the floor function for y = 1.1\*n, for n going from 1 to 10 is   floor(1.1\*1,1.1\*2,1.1\*3…..1.1\*10) = floor(1.1,2.2,3.3…11) = (1,2,3…11)

At  the tenth number, the number is actually 11.  I can think of a  \*lot\*  more ways to generate the sequence 1,2,3,4,5,6,7…and have it break  from  that pattern whenever I want to by dipping into math.

This  is why you \*never\* see number sequence  problems on even a test such as  the SAT without a specification that the  terms appear in an Arithmetic  or Geometric sequence, or are given some  additional information beyond  the sequence itself to constrain the  possible choices.

When  something like a number sequence is generated in the “wild” of  nature  and comes out like 4,9,16,25…you can probably bet that the next  number  is 36.  That’s because it was produced by the laws of physics. In  the  real world, when a number sequence arises it usually arises out of   dependable laws.  This then lets you do a bunch of clever pro math   things like smoothing out a graph and you can then \*reliably\* use cool   math stuff to find the pattern to a sequence.

But  when the sequence is concocted out of thin air for a test?  It  loses  all possible validity. Its just an exercise in frustration,  because you  \*know\* there are an infinite amount of plausible formulas to  create  the number sequence.  Because of that, Hoeflin may have even  just  handed out the scores to the test randomly.  Heck, maybe he even  chose  the “right” answer after someone gave the most plausible sounding   solution.   So if you think a question like this dosen’t make sense…7 8 5   3 9 8 1 6 3 \_\_\_  well, you’re right.

**Image Sequence Problems**

📷

Hey,  maybe the sequence problems are a bit better, right?  Wrong.   Those  “find the pattern in the 3 by 3 grid” problems are just as bad. In   fact, they contain each and every flaw in the number sequence problems.   Let me prove it.   Number each square from 1 to 9, starting top left to   bottom right.  Now, each and every move like (move right 1, down 1)  can  be mapped as add 4, subtract 5, multiply by 2…etc.

To really make it work, you have to add something [called modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic).    Its basically like putting the numbers on a clock, and \*then\* doing   arithmetic, where 11 aclock plus 3 is 2 aclock.  But once you do that,   the number sequence and image sequence problems are the same.

**So Now then…**

So,  why don’t you see any of the Big Names in math or physics like   Terrence Tao take this test to really show they are the smartest person   in the world?  Because it includes a bunch of homework problems from   courses they have already done!…and not even the hardest problems in the   courses.  Any other math big name would immediately spot how absurd  the  whole thing is, and call the guy out as a charlatan.

**Other Ways the test Is invalid**

Ok,  so its non-verbal section is super bad. What about its verbal   section?  Well, each and every question in the Verbal IQ is an analogy.   Every single one.  Absolutely no questions about reading a book and   knowing who the characters were. Nothing about reading a long passage   and understanding what is going on.  Just analogies.

And  you know what?  Analogies \*used\* to be on tests like the SAT,  GRE,  LSAT…but eventually, each and every major university and graduate   school removed the analogy section from their tests due to all the   specific issues with them that other sections under the “verbal   reasoning” basked didn’t have.

Here is a good example of a cultural trivia question masquerading as a pure raw test of reasoning.

21. Pride : Prejudice :: Sense : ?, from the Ultra test.

Well  guess what. If you know Jane Austen and her books, then this  question  is a breeze.She wrote Pride and Prejudice and Sense and  Sensibility.   If you don’t know that, then you have to go through each  and every  possible word in the dictionary and try your hardest to come  up with a  possible similar relationship between the two, and even with  infinite  intelligence you’re not coming up with anything. This is  \*absolutely\*  dependent on that bit of cultural knowledge.

Here  is a question with a huge amount of possible answers, huge  amounts of  equally valid reasoning that really shows just why analogies  such as  this should never be on an exam(but I will admit, are a useful  type of  reasoning in everyday life).

4. MICE : MEN :: CABBAGES : ?

So…there  are numerous relations I can think of between the word Mice  and the  word Men. I can think of size differences.  I can try finding  the  genetic distance between the average mouse and the average man and  try  the closest “distance” of a plant species from an average cabbage. I   can go the route of book titles “Of Mice and Men” and try finding a   book with similar phrasing, except involving cabbages.   Its obviously a   fruitless effort. There is no proof for whatever I come up with.

These  really bad questions are the \*entirety\* of the verbal  capability  score.  Not only has the analogy section been removed from  virtually  every test, but this test in particular is full of the “worst”  examples  of analogies.  Its like the guy didn’t even try. But that’s  not what  the maker was after. Nah, the usual fame and money the quick  and easy  way, and being in charge of the “Pay 50 bucks for your shot at  the mega  society” test.

**Summary**

So  the test is bunk. If you care about brightness, focus on actual   accomplishments that \*real\* institutions and groups of people value,   like majoring with a 4.0 at the top of plenty of classes,  or publishing   some insightful paper in a topic, or creating a new result…or anything   like that. Don’t focus on an “IQ” test that reminds one of the famous   statement of Stephen Hawking

"On the internet(which means reddit and 4chan), I am not very nice to people. I do not usually harass anyone but I am mostly curt and to the point. When I get into a flame war I don't hold back, and use the regular 4chan lingo, call people retarded, invoke their mothers, and do everything that happens on the anonymous internet. My online persona is one of a person with hardline political views(including things like the political disenfranchisement of entire communities, state-sponsored retaliatory ethnic violence, asking for people to be thrown from helicopters etc) who is not afraid to get into ugly verbal spats to defend them. My comments are often ironic calls for violence against people I consider bad. 

I also happen to be an internet addict. I regularly spend upto 8 hours a day on the web, posting on different forums. Sufficient to say, I do not have much of a life outside posting on the web. I do workout a little and do consistently well school/career wise, but a regular social life is not something I have.

Of late, I get a feeling that my online persona has started to bleed into my offline persona. It feels like years(6-7 years, to be exact) of getting into flame wars on the internet has radically altered my personality and made into a different person. I have had conversations with people that have ended with them being hurt and never speaking to me, because of the way I came across. I have ended up as somewhat of a pariah, with very few people wanting to genuinely be friends with me. I get the feeling that the word of my abnormal behavior has gotten around, I am being ostracized from social groups, not being invited to parties etc. I still have a few friends, I am by no means lonely, but I also have a large number of people who dislike me, and I feel some of it might be attributed to habits carried over from my behaviour on the internet.

What I want is to understand the context for Trump's trade agenda, especially as it relates to China & NAFTA. Does anyone have any go-to sources for understanding these things? I feel completely uninformed.

Some questions: what are the causes of antagonism between the US and its trade partners both in North America & in China? Are US trade deals obviously slanted in some way, and what does that actually look like, in a technical sense? If they are slanted, why are they slanted? If they're not, why do people like Trump think they are? Is Trump pushing a particular strain of economic thought? I'm sure there are obvious questions I'm missing, because that's how little I know.

Basically, I feel like my understanding of this issue is 100% heat, 0% light. I'd like to change that.

"[This is an interesting NYT feature about the reduction in abundance of insect species, first noted by an association of german amateur entomologists.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html)

One thing that should be noted is that counting populations of wild animals is hard. Recently, estimates of the number of gorillas were increased with 100 000, due to new found populations in Congo and gorillas are the largest primate, far easier to count then ants.

The second is how counterintuitive the drop in insect numbers is. Europe, from where most of this evidence comes from, has strict pollution controls, has cutback on the use of chemical insecticides, forbidden GMO and has endured a process of reforestation and rewilding that had restored lots of the forest cover and allowed for introduction and reintroduction of large wild animals.

That the current insect population is far smaller than in the 70's and the 80's, before these measures went into effect surprises me.   ",The Insect Apocalypse Is Here,a30fj0,new,26,67,67,0

"I procrastinate a lot. Probably I spend at least 4-5 hours per day on time-wasting activities I don’t even really enjoy because I don’t want to work but I won’t let myself engage in leisure because I should be working. (Also, it’s gotten bad enough I don’t even really know what I would *do* with real leisure time.)

I also can’t seem to maintain the sleep schedule I want. I stay up too late and sleep in well past my alarm every day unless I have a good reason to wake up earlier. 

I have never been able to maintain a regular exercise regime, no matter how much I want to. 

I know I’m capable of not having these problems; when a deadline is coming up I can work steadily without a problem; when I was in high school I woke up at 6:30AM every day; and with social pressure I know I could exercise every day. Really these are all versions of the same problem, which is that I have a hard time doing what I know is best for me in the long-term in the absence of immediate external pressure. 

I realize that literally everyone has this problem, which is why my procrastination and sleep habits are the norm for college students and why obesity is a thing.

Still, some people have clearly addressed it better than others. I’d like to know what the people who have addressed it well are doing differently than the people who haven’t. Does anyone have any insight into this?

"I’m collecting instances where a person or entity that is supposed to hold merely theoretical power one day successfully asserts and uses the power in question. Here are three stories.

Fascist Italy was a dictatorship with Benito Mussolini in charge. But notionally he was subordinate to something called the [Grand Council of Fascism]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Council_of_Fascism) which could in theory depose him. Just a technicality, right? You're not going to get rid of a fascist dictator with a polite vote in some stupid committee, are you? Well, on July 25, 1943, the Grand Council met and voted on a no confidence measure for Mussolini. The vote passed 19 to 8. Mussolini was deposed and arrested and [another guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Badoglio) put in charge.

In 1944, the Kingdom of Iceland became the Republic of Iceland, with a new republican constitution. Instead of a ceremonial king the country now had a ceremonial president. Article 26 of the [Icelandic constitution](https://www.government.is/Publications/Legislation/Lex/?newsid=89fc6038-fd28-11e7-9423-005056bc4d74) states that the president is to sign laws but can in theory veto them, triggering a referendum. But in reality the president is just a ceremonial figure so for 60 years, all Icelandic presidents rubber-stamped every law passed by parliament. Then one day in June 2004, the president did decide to [veto a law](https://mg.co.za/article/2004-05-17-iceland-in-crisis-over-controversial-media-law), triggering a constitutional crisis and a clash between the government and the president. It turned out to be hard to argue that the text of the constitution didn’t mean what it so clearly says. The president won this confrontation and proceeded to successfully veto [two]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_loan_guarantees_referendum,_2010) [more]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_loan_guarantees_referendum,_2011) laws a few years down the line.

Communist Poland was a one-party state with, well, the Communist Party in charge. In theory, other political parties existed and were even allotted some seats in parliament but these ‘satellite parties’ had no real power and were basically for show. They were entirely subordinate to the Communists. Then in 1989 [a mostly free election]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_legislative_election,_1989
) was allowed for 35% of the seats in parliament. The newly formed opposition party Solidarity won basically every one of these seats. This was unexpected and a big blow to the Communists. But still, no worries. The Communists and their satellite parties still held 65% of parliament so Communist rule wasn't in danger. Except that at this point the satellite parties [deserted the Communists]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_legislative_election,_1989#Aftermath) and decided to team up with Solidarity instead. Whoops. Guess they weren’t just a sham after all.

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of December 03, 2018

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

"There is some evidence that dolphins are able to communicate with each other in some way that conveys concrete concepts.  

Dolphins in captivity are able to coordinate new behaviors on the fly:  
>When given the hand signal to “innovate,” Hector and Han know to dip below the surface and blow a bubble, or vault out of the water, or dive down to the ocean floor, or perform any of the dozen or so other maneuvers in their repertoire—but not to repeat anything they’ve already done during that session. Incredibly, they usually understand that they’re supposed to keep trying some new behavior each session. 

>...

>Bolton presses her palms together over her head, the signal to innovate, and then puts her fists together, the sign for “tandem.” With those two gestures, she has instructed the dolphins to show her a behavior she hasn’t seen during this session and to do it in unison.

>Hector and Han disappear beneath the surface. With them is a comparative psychologist named Stan Kuczaj, wearing a wet suit and snorkel gear and carrying a large underwater video camera with hydrophones. He records several seconds of audible chirping between Hector and Han, then his camera captures them both slowly rolling over in unison and flapping their tails three times simultaneously.

>Above the surface Bolton presses her thumbs and middle fingers together, telling the dolphins to keep up this cooperative innovation. And they do. The 400-pound animals sink down, exchange a few more high-pitched whistles, and then simultaneously blow bubbles together. Then they pirouette side by side. Then they tail walk. After eight nearly perfectly synchronized sequences, the session ends.

(from https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2015/05/dolphin-intelligence-human-communication/ )

As the article points out, this is not conclusive evidence of communication, as one dolphin may just be mimicking the other extremely proficiently.

Dolphins also are known to use unique whistles to refer to individual creatures.

Experiments to demonstrate whether dolphins are capable of communicating arbitrary concepts have been inconclusive:

>Bastian designed an experiment in which dolphins were required to inform each other about an (arbitrary) event using whatever communicative skills they had at their disposal in order to obtain a food reward. Two dolphins—a male named Buzz and a female named Doris—were placed in the same pool that was divided in half by a mesh net. They were able to both see each other and hear each other's vocalizations. The dolphins were trained to press a paddle that corresponded to the state of a light positioned above their pool—either flashing or steady. They were only rewarded if both dolphins pressed the correct paddle, and only if Buzz pressed his first. The two dolphins had little trouble learning this task (i.e., small potatoes as far as dolphin cognition goes). In the next phase of the experiment, an opaque barrier was placed between the two pools, so that the dolphins could no longer see each other, but could still hear each other's vocalizations. Importantly, Buzz was now no longer able to see the light—only Doris knew whether or not it was flashing or steady. So it was up to Doris to ""tell"" Buzz about the light, so that he could press the correct paddle and they would both obtain their food reward. Much to the researchers' delight, this is exactly what appeared to happen. While positioned in front of the paddle corresponding to the state of the light, Doris emitted a series of vocalizations, and Buzz pressed the correct paddle in his pool on nearly every trial. The tentative conclusion was that Doris had been communicating arbitrary novel information to Buzz (i.e., the state of a light) using her vocalizations.
 
>Bastian was not satisfied with this experiment, and, as is the hallmark of science, began implementing strict controls in subsequent experiments to ferret out potential confounding factors that might alter his provocative conclusion. He found that Doris produced the same vocalizations regardless of whether or not Buzz could see the light, and even if Buzz was not in the pool. This challenged the idea that Doris was intentionally transmitting information to Buzz about the state of the light. The more parsimonious explanation for the original finding was that Buzz was using other information to determine which paddle he needed to press. The final conclusion was that Buzz was able to localize where Doris was in the pool (i.e., which paddle she was positioned in front of) by listening to her vocalizations. He then chose the correct paddle by simply being able to differentiate between Doris being farther or closer away when she vocalized, not via linguistic information found in her vocalizations. Researchers at Dolphinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands replicated Bastian's study and obtained almost identical results to that of Bastian. After analysis of the dolphins' vocalizations, the Harderwijk researchers determined that there was no difference in the structure of the vocalizations emitted by the dolphins for each for the two conditions (i.e., light flashing or steady), and that it was the position of the vocalizing dolphin that allowed the listening dolphin to make the correct choice. Unfortunately, the Discovery Channel/Animal Planets' and a handful of authors chose to popularize the conclusion from Bastian's initial experiment (i.e., dolphins can communicate abstract ideas), ignoring the fact that a host of other scientists, including Bastian himself, later insisted that this conclusion was unequivocally wrong. 

(from Are Dolphins Really Smart?: The mammal behind the myth
By Justin Gregg )

The results of this study are also complicated by the fact that the dolphins Buzz and Doris were taken from the wild as infants, perhaps too young to have learned a dolphin communication code if one exists.

Surely there must be a way to design an experiment that is capable of demonstrating that dolphins possess the ability to communicate arbitrary concepts if they have that ability. One could set up a system of puzzles or tasks perhaps along the line of Bastian's experiment, but making sure the experiment is constructed in such a way that it's impossible to complete the tasks without communicating specific information.  

Even if we think it's unlikely that dolphins possess this ability, I believe that the small chance that they do possess it obligates us to attempt to design and perform this experiment: if dolphins are a sapient species, recognizing that they are sapient would prevent their mistreatment and protect their welfare, and conclusively demonstrating that they can communicate with each other would generate a lot of interest and make it easier to fund further experiments to decipher whatever languages the dolphins may use.

"I think we’ve all heard about He Jiankui by now, who claims to be the first to have brought gene-edited human embryos to term. He’s probably right. 

However, as the stories condemning the unethical behaviour of these experiments have grown ever-more plentiful, I have noticed that some things are missing from the media narrative: the big picture. 

I’m simplifying here, but China is a communist state, and as such, its people will be more assets than citizens. A strong population will make for a strong country, and human gene editing (and eugenics) will only further such a project. 

China has an under-way HIV epidemic. They’ve been trying to contain it since the early 2000s. It was initially restricted to injection drug users in the southern provinces, and the infection then spread into the population of men having sex with men. This was the situation in the late 00s, with about half of transmission being drug-related and the other half being sexual. 

E. g. 2007 article on the epidemic: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp078010

Fast-forward to the mid-2010s, and the epidemic is not contained, but it’s spreading into the young population—fuelled by increasingly-liberal attitudes to sex and a lack of sexual education for people to know how to protect themselves. 

https://qz.com/817266/hiv-is-growing-so-fast-among-chinese-youth-that-a-university-is-selling-testing-kits-in-vending-machines/amp/

By this year, the Chinese government has pledged to strengthen its efforts into HIV prevention and treatment. 

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30098-7/fulltext

Somehow, mainstream media reporting on the gene editing-fracas seem to have completely failed to see this big picture, and instead everyone (except the specialists) seem confused with He having chosen to edit the CCR5 gene, when HIV is seen as a treatable and chronic disease—but one requiring expensive and life-long medication (which really isn’t going to run well with the communist authoritarian idea of governing a population of übermenschen). Rather, CCR5 is a perfectly logical target for human gene-editing to focus on.

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/ethics-aside-does-crispr-baby-experiment-make-scientific-sense

But that still leaves part of the mystery: why is this publicised when it seems like the gene-editing might not have been successful? (It is reported that neither of the two twins born has a ‘clean’ mutation, and that at least one of the girls might be a mosaic; having both edited and wild-type cells.)

This is where I think some comments from you might be interesting. 

The way I see it, there is 0% possibility that He somehow ‘went rogue’ and that Chinese authorities had no idea of what he was doing. I’m sure they knew. But why all this negative publicity, when the limited success of the experiment could easily have been buried underground: nobody would have needed to know. So the fact that we know is probably engineered. But for what purpose? 

According to the knee-jerk reactions that were already seeing, with people condemning this work, it is likely that the Anglo-European world is going to strengthen regulations into human gene editing. If China does not do this, whatever head start they already have will grow greater over time—which makes perfect sense over the long term (if you’re the Chinese government and have plans for world dominion).

"General Patton's [speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton%27s_speech_to_the_Third_Army#The_speech) to the Third Army in the early months of 1944 is an instructive text. It's a good speech, well-designed to motivate Patton's green troops for the carnage ahead. Patton assumes the rhetorical position of cutting the bullshit and levelling with you about how things really are. This is accomplished by the use of profanity and with a counter-narrative to some polite conventional wisdom:  

>Men, all this stuff you hear about America not wanting to fight, wanting to stay out of the war, is a lot of bullshit. Americans love to fight. All real Americans love the sting and clash of battle.  

The speech goes on to extoll the virtues of aggression, acting as part of a larger whole, obedience to orders, and the ennobling nature of war:

>Battle is the most significant competition in which a man can indulge. It brings out all that is best and it removes all that is base.  

There are also some stern warnings against wrong behavior, in particular cowardice:

>Each man must think not only of himself, but think of his buddy fighting alongside him. We don't want yellow cowards in the army. They should be killed off like flies. If not, they will go back home after the war, goddamn cowards, and breed more cowards. The brave men will breed more brave men. Kill off the goddamn cowards and we'll have a nation of brave men.

World War II is often conceived of as an ideological war but no considerations of that sort are present in Patton's speech. There's nothing about the evils of Nazi ideology or the goodness of democratic ideals - there's not even a token reference to 'freedom'. Patton presumably felt that this wasn't the sort of thing that would motivate his soldiers, going for something very simple and raw.

The speech is an example of a pattern that George Orwell had noted in his 1941 essay [Wells, Hitler and the World State](http://orwell.ru/library/reviews/wells/english/e_whws). High-minded intellectual opposition to fascism is not what motivates a normal person, instead you probably need some atavistic nationalism of your own:

>All sensible men for decades past have been substantially in agreement with what Mr. Wells says; but the sensible men have no power and, in too many cases, no disposition to sacrifice themselves. Hitler is a criminal lunatic, and Hitler has an army of millions of men, aeroplanes in thousands, tanks in tens of thousands. For his sake a great nation has been willing to overwork itself for six years and then to fight for two years more, whereas for the common-sense, essentially hedonistic world-view which Mr. Wells puts forward, hardly a human creature is willing to shed a pint of blood. Before you can even talk of world reconstruction, or even of peace, you have got to eliminate Hitler, which means bringing into being a dynamic not necessarily the same as that of the Nazis, but probably quite as unacceptable to ‘enlightened’ and hedonistic people. What has kept England on its feet during the past year? In part, no doubt, some vague idea about a better future, but chiefly the atavistic emotion of patriotism, the ingrained feeling of the English-speaking peoples that they are superior to foreigners. For the last twenty years the main object of English left-wing intellectuals has been to break this feeling down, and if they had succeeded, we might be watching the S.S. men patrolling the London streets at this moment. Similarly, why are the Russians fighting like tigers against the German invasion? In part, perhaps, for some half-remembered ideal of Utopian Socialism, but chiefly in defence of Holy Russia (the ‘sacred soil of the Fatherland’, etc. etc.), which Stalin has revived in an only slightly altered from. The energy that actually shapes the world springs from emotions — racial pride, leader-worship, religious belief, love of war — which liberal intellectuals mechanically write off as anachronisms, and which they have usually destroyed so completely in themselves as to have lost all power of action.",Patton's Speech,a1j205,new,49,95,95,0

It is my understanding that Cognifocus is a nootropic of some kind. From Googling it they appear to use marketing that refers to ""focus fixes"" etc, so kind of like a drug influence on the target market if you ask me. Nothing about ""cognifocus after school programs"" comes up on google although the foregoing is a suggested search term for Cognifocus itself. And if you were doing an after school program involving dosing kids with a shady chemical (I bought aniracetam by mail, I know of what I speak lol) wouldn't that make the news and/or have some kind of search result presence? Furthermore, why ask followup questions via Rewards to people not even involved in the program itself?

  
Reason I'm asking here is people seem to be fairly well-rounded on all the subjects I address above and tend also to consider unusual lines of inquiry. I'm not trying to make some kind of conspiracy but this at least seems disturbing and probably unethical, and it definitely reminds me of MKULTRA as well lol.

The Wednesday Wellness threads are meant to encourage users to ask for and provide advice and motivation to improve their lives. It isn't intended as a 'containment thread' and if you should feel free to post content which could go here in it's own thread.  
You could post:

- Requesting advice and / or encouragement. On basically any topic and for any scale of problem.

- Updates to let us know how you are doing. This provides valuable feedback on past advice / encouragement and will hopefully make people feel a little more motivated to follow through. If you want to be reminded to post your update, see the post titled 'update reminders', below.

- Advice. This can be in response to a request for advice or just something that you think could be generally useful for many people here.

- Encouragement. Probably best directed at specific users, but if you feel like just encouraging people in general I don't think anyone is going to object. I don't think I really need to say this, but just to be clear; encouragement should have a generally positive tone and not shame people (if people feel that shame might be an effective tool for motivating people, please discuss this so we can form a group consensus on how to use it rather than just trying it).

- Discussion about the thread itself. At the moment the format is rather rough and could probably do with some improvement. Please make all posts of this kind as replies to the top-level comment which starts with META (or replies to those replies, etc.). Otherwise I'll leave you to organise the thread as you see fit, since Reddit's layout actually seems to work OK for keeping things readable.

For me, it's Linus Pauling and David R Hawkin's *The Orthomolecular Treatment of Schizophrenia,* written in 1973*.* He finds that many people in psychiatric wards are extremely deficient in many vitamins. A person deficient in vitamin B1, B12, C and D is iirc 60x more likely to be admitted to a mental ward than someone who isn't deficient in any of those vitamins. His writing about how B vitamins affect brain functioning in alcoholics is fascinating as well - some of them regained brain function that was seemingly gone forever after taking B vitamin megadoses, which he theorized was due to the fact that they had severely impaired their ability to metabolize vitamin B3. He also discusses how some vitamin deficiencies can mimic schizophrenia - you can become floridly psychotic when severely nutrient-deprived, but depending on which hospital you go to you might end up on antipsychotics instead of vitamins.

"I've noticed this fallacy a lot lately. I don't know if there's an actual name for it so I'm just calling it a False False Equivalence. I suppose it could also be a subset of strawmanning. This fallacy happens when one person makes an analogy to illustrate a point and another person replies that those two things cannot be compared even though the analogy is apt.

**Example**

>**Person A**: I believe Antifa is a fascist organization.

>**Person B**: How can they be a fascist organization? It says right in the name, they are anti-fascist.

>**Person A**: The name doesn't matter. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea isn't democratic.

>**Person B**: Are you really comparing antifa to North Korea?

Person B has committed the false false equivalence. They have incorrectly reduced a good analogy that demonstrates that names do not always reflect reality to something else entirely.

An analogy does not mean you are saying two things are identical. You are merely saying that these two things are similar in this one specific way. 

Of course, this does not mean all analogies are apt. False equivalence is still a thing we have to be wary of. 

Also, please note in the above example that I do not believe person A is correct in their initial statement. There are many valid arguments as to why antifa isn't fascist but the name isn't one of them.

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of November 26, 2018

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/slatestarcodex's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.

"First, some context for my argument: a long time ago, the concept of honor was very important in western civilization.  Unless you are in the military or maybe the police, the definition of honor is probably alien to you.  I believe that most western people today couldn't explain what it is if you asked them.

Even my own definition has to be long and drawn out: before long distance communication and rapid transit, people tended to know each other quite well.  Someone's ""honor"" described their reputation, usually in terms of their willingness to keep their word, to support the greater good of the community or the rules ahead of their personal interests.  These things would be summed up in a single word, does that person have honor or not.  Today, this is probably only relevant for people in the military.  For everyone else, having ""honor"" (which we may as well put in quotes at this point) is a disadvantage, one that will get you widely mocked by many people or even treated as if you are a bad person depending on who you're dealing with.  Most people are better off shuffling from group to group, taking advantage of the presumptions that come with their anonymity, being litigious and playing the victim as a strategy to express their hostility, virtue signalling instead of virtue doing.  In these ways the long, slow march towards degeneracy continues and those few people who hold onto what they believe honor is get abused or even targeted for their trouble.

Enter China's social credit system.  In the US, you are already profiled by Google (who knows all sorts of strange things about you, for example, when I started dating an Indian woman all of my click bait ads changed from Asian women to Indian women), Facebook (we know they put people into categories based upon their political beliefs and switch shadow bans on and off at select times) etc.  The government can, per Edward Snowden et al., hack into your devices any time they want even if we choose to believe that their huge data centers don't exist for the purpose of profiling us.  The future existence of forums like The_Donald (and this forum) may be in question.  So ask yourself this question: do you want your profile to be held by private companies and in secret by the government, in which case you likely have no recourse if it is used against you, or do you want it to be held by the government as an open public record, at which point you may be able to dispute it?

In the best case scenario, open public records might return us to a state where a form of honor is relevant in society instead of the current state of affairs, in which it's a fools game and those who have it are taken advantage of or even openly targeted, generally for implicitly threatening degenerates because they dared to live up to their own standards.

"Looking through some of Scott's old posts [such as this one](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/06/28/why-are-transgender-people-immune-to-optical-illusions/), he seems to make much of a purported link between autism and transgenderism.

I have to say, based on my knowledge of autism and autistic people, I find such a link *extremely* counterintuitive. It's my understanding that Simon Baron-Cohen's work indicated that autism resulted from over-masculinization of the brain in the pre-natal environment. From this we see a typical male psychological such as interest in non-living systems and disinterest in social stimuli taken up to eleven.

The prediction I would've made from this is that the deeper you move into the autistic spectrum, the less likelihood of a given biological male human being transgendered. I would've guessed that prenatal feminization of the brain, the opposite effect, would be the main cause behind gender dysphoria in males.

That a large number of trans people apparently score high on autistic traits is *extremely* surprising to me. I'm not actually sure whether to believe it. And no one else seems to be raising an eyebrow at this highly unlikely result.

"Tyler Cowen has a new book (*Stubborn Attachments*) in which he argues that boosting economic growth is of paramount importance. I haven't read the book, so this shouldn't be taken as a criticism of Cowen (and I probably have no right even posting this - ye have been warned). However, there appear (to me) to be at least 2 reasonable counter-arguments (even taking for granted an Econcentric, utilitarian premise):

1) As I think has been mentioned here, we are seeing less growth despite dramatic increases in the number of researchers, it’s plausible our gdp/capita will eventually plateau, in which case boosting economic growth could have very finite positive impact. For instance, if we assume utility relates logarithmically with consumption and it will plateau in 30 years, boosting the growth rate by 0.1% will get us there a couple of months sooner, which is comparable with boosting current GDP by a few tenths of a percent.

2) If utility grows sub-logarithmically with income, the the utility from higher growth rate is likewise limited, even if GDP/capita grows without bound. For instance, suppose utility \~ -1/x. Then, increasing the growth rate by 0.1% is (very roughly) equally utility-creating as boosting current GDP by 5%.

My intuition is that they are very underestimated. Also this sounds like a problem perfect for ML to solve.

Also to do effective research on lie detectors there needs to be real stakes on the line for the person lying.

"Recently finished The Righteous Mind... two years after everyone else.

A train of thought occurred to me and I'm wondering if there is already a discussion of it:

- Haidt proposes that moral instincts can evolve rapidly
- Culture evolves even more rapidly and the two play off one another
- WEIRD morality is a relatively recent and artificial thing
- WEIRD morality seems to be increasingly dominant in the highest echelons of the wealthiest societies - and those who become more successful in our society are more likely to adopt it

Is WEIRD morality an inevitable evolutionary response to some rapidly developing environmental change? It sheds the loyalty, authority, and sanctity instincts, which suggests the new environment does not require humans to bond with small groups for survival. It overemphasizes the liberty, care, and fairness instincts, suggesting these are crucial to success.

Is the environmental change the emergence of the bureaucratic and technocratic nation state? In the nation state, it is increasingly unnecessary and even unhelpful to belong to smaller groupings or to rely on bonds of trust. It is important to operate as an individual since this is how the law is structured, it is important to treat others as individuals, it is important to be egalitarian to avoid the possibility of mob overthrow, and it is necessary to emphasize liberty in order to keep the nation state's enormity in check.

A collapse of the current world order might select for traditional moral instincts again, but increasing stability in western nation states could cause WEIRD humans to be even more successful than they are now.",Jonathan Haidt redux: evolving morality,9z02l8,new,9,13,13,0

"The 30 year fixed rate mortgage has been the standard in the US for as long as any living person can remember, despite the fact that they do not do their job well.  This is the result of a number of accidents of history, and the world would be a better place if the situation were corrected.

The first sign that the 30 year mortgage is not necessarily a natural fit for consumer demand is that [the US is basically alone in its reliance on it](https://business.sdsu.edu/_resources/files/real-estate/research/10122_Research_RIHA_Lea_Report.pdf).  Something like 95% of US mortgages are long term fixed rate mortgages.  In the UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Korea, Spain, and Switzerland, virtually no mortgages have a fixed interest rate and a long term.  Denmark, France, Germany, and Japan have some fixed mortgages, but shorter terms of repayment are common and variable rate mortgages are available.

This idiosyncratic outcome is a result of [US government intervention in the mortgage market](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-financial-102710-144920).  In 1934, the Federal Housing Administration effectively created the fixed-rate mortgage with the National Housing Act, which authorized the FHA to provide mortgage insurance on 20 year fixed rate mortgages with 20% downpayments.  The term for repayment eventually moved up to 30 years, but not much else has changed.  Fannie Mae was created in 1938 to purchase FHA-insured mortgages.  Veterans Affairs was authorized to insure fixed rate loans soon afterwards.  Federally insured Savings and Loan institutions (S&Ls) were restricted to only offer fixed rate mortgages until 1981!  To this very day, the Federal government dominates mortgage policy through FHFA, FHA, VA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae policies, many of which either subsidize fixed rate mortgages or regulate against potential alternatives.  Even if government policy became more neutral overnight, the 30 year fixed is now the Schelling point for the US mortgage market.

None of this would matter all that much if the 30 year fixed was good at its job.  Sadly, it is not.  The reason is that borrowers of 30 year fixed rate mortgages hold a very valuable option, and sophisticated institutional investors like those which own and originate mortgages don't just give options away for free.  When you take out a mortgage, you could repay it one month later with no penalty, or you could keep it outstanding for 30 years.  So if you borrow at 5% and interest rates go to 10% tomorrow, you got a great bargain and you can keep that loan for many many years.  The bank will get paid below market interest the whole time.  But if you borrow at 5% and interest rates go to 1% tomorrow, you will certainly refinance as soon as possible, and the bank doesn't get to enjoy earning that above-market interest rate at all.  To make it worthwhile for the bank to sell you this valuable option, it needs to get paid for it.

$15 trillion of mortgages are outstanding in the US, and sophisticated models of the value of this prepayment option given typical borrower behavior and interest rate volatility estimate its value at about 0.50% added to the interest rate of the loan.  That means that US borrowers pay about $75 billion per year for this option.

Actually exercising the option by refinancing is costly for borrowers, and frictions in the process drain economic productivity (requiring needless professional labor, time out of work, etc). 
Borrowers who cannot refinance must continue paying a needlessly high rate, often requiring patchwork policy corrections after the fact (i.e. HARP, HAMP) and sometimes leading to increased credit losses.  Meanwhile, the process of some 90 million Americans struggling to monitor the interest rate market and optimize their refinancing activity, in order to efficiently exercise that option they paid $75 billion for in aggregate, is at least as suboptimal as you would expect.

Meanwhile, a mortgage with a fixed monthly payment and a fixed interest rate has another very undesirable trait: in early years, the huge bulk of each payment goes towards paying interest, leaving very little to pay principal.  Home equity thus builds extremely slowly.  This exposes lenders (and the taxpayer behind government guaranteed mortgages which dominate the market) to substantially greater credit risk while also necessitating larger downpayment requirements for any given level of safety.

The most popular alternative worldwide is an adjustable-rate mortgage.  However, this has its own obvious downside -- if the interest rate goes up, the monthly mortgage payment goes up with it, and if you are a mortgage borrower up to your neck in debt and other required payments, that might cause you to fall behind on your mortgage.  Empirically, ARMs default at a lower rate than fixed-rates all else equal, but we can still do better.

Enter the [Fixed Payment, Floating Rate Mortgage](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3029740), or ""Fixed COFI"" mortgage.  This proposal, which has cropped up in research by Federal Reserve economists over the past few years, offers the best of both worlds.

The structure is as follows: the mortgage borrower will owe a fixed monthly payment, just as if they had borrowed at a 30 year fixed rate.  However, the interest rate is not fixed, it can vary in both directions, and is tied to banks' cost of funding index or COFI (not a more slippery index like LIBOR).  This means that the complex interest rate risk associated with the prepayment option no longer exists -- the mortgage is always paying a market-level interest rate.  Without the option cost, this market rate will generally be lower than the prevailing 30 year fixed rate.  Borrowers save interest costs, and since the payment is held fixed, the principal balance declines faster, making these mortgages safer from a default perspective as well.  Borrowers don't have to become mortgage interest rate experts to refinance their mortgage efficiently, the rate moves on its own.  And when economic conditions call for the Federal Reserve to change interest rates, those changes will immediately pass through to borrowers' mortgage rates, making it easier for monetary policy to cushion the blow of economic downturns like 2008.  On average, borrowers repay mortgages in far less than 30 years and save mountains of interest, all while giving investors a debt security that is easier to hedge and poses less risks, and exposing taxpayers to lower risk of holding the bag for Fannie, Freddie, or to-big-to-fail banks.

What is the downside?  Well, it's a floating-rate mortgage, so that bad scenario is if interest rates go up.  This is covered in vast detail in the link above, but here is the gist of it.  With a fixed payment and higher interest rate, the share of the monthly payment that goes to interest goes up, and the share that goes to principal declines, perhaps even to zero.  If rates oscillate higher and lower over the life of the mortgage, this is no problem.  But what if they go much higher and then stay higher?  Still no problem for the borrower: the fixed payment and maximum 30 year term are guaranteed.  But it is a problem for the taxpayer guaranteeing the mortgage: whatever principal hasn't been repaid over 30 years has to get written off, and the government holds the bag.

The good news is that in all of history, this never would have been a problem.  But lets say it happens now, just to piss us off.  This would only be an issue for mortgages that are still outstanding 30 years later, meaning the borrower never moved.  Most people move more than a couple of times in each 30 year time period.  Moreover, the credit losses take place 30 years from now, which gives us ample time to collect reserves from them (much like how Ginnie Mae maintains a mortgage insurance fund, we could maintain an insurance fund paid by a small guarantee fee on each mortgage).  Moreover, this risk is fundamentally an interest rate risk, so it can be priced as an interest rate option: according to options models that take into account borrower behavior, it is a much less costly option for the taxpayer or investor to be short compared to the big prepayment option that borrowers have today.

It is understandable why the government didn't come up with this idea in 1934 when they basically invented the U.S. mortgage market.  With the historical experience we have, the international examples of the merits of the adjustable rate mortgage, and advances in computing power and theoretical framework to value complex interest rate options and compare them, we don't have a similar excuse anymore.  The 30 year fixed rate mortgage should become a vestigial part of our financial system, not continue as one of its government-mandated cornerstones.",The 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage: Accident of History,9yv1i3,new,33,76,76,0

"Prior to the midterm elections a few of us had a little [contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9qki62/us_senate_prediction_contest/) to see who could best predict the Senate results of the ten states expected to be most competitive. Now that all races are decided, let's check the results!

The scoring criteria was that errors (in either direction) were summed and the contestant with the lowest total aggregate error would be the winner. I've divided that number by ten here to show average error, which is basically the same thing but more intuitive. So the numbers below represent how different that user's guesses were from the actual outcome (as reported by RCP) on average.

The results:

1. u/jdoe1029384756 \- 3.63
2. u/AshLael \- 3.69
3. u/SlightlyLessHairyApe \- 4.38
4. u/ThirteenValleys \- 4.61
5. u/werttrew \- 5.1
6. u/Edmund-Nelson \- 5.48
7. u/NCIMB8052 \- 5.83

Congratulations to u/jdoe1029384756 \- and thanks to u/NCIMB8052 for finding the error in my math that understated his performance!

~~Congratulations to me, I guess.~~

~~The biggest reason for my win was Indiana - I guessed that Braun would win by 5 and he won by 5.9, giving me an error of 0.9. Meanwhile this was the state with the biggest average error, with the average guess being 7.5 points off. However it's not entirely due to that as I would have still narrowly won even if I had made an average-sized error here.~~

Interestingly, u/Edmund-Nelson did quite poorly, despite taking his guesses straight from 538's model. The only competitor who did worse wasn't even making his best guess, but rather strategically positioning himself to benefit from any Democratic overperformance (Republicans did well in the Senate so this didn't pan out, but it was a sound strategy). Apparently r/slatestarcodex is a better predictor than Nate Silver - though n=7, so nothing to get too excited about yet.

I had fun with this and am definitely thinking about doing something like it again for future elections. Would anyone else be interested in competing over next year's Australian election?  


EDIT: I originally incorrectly reported myself as the winner, which has been changed.

"Culture War Roundup for the Week of November 19, 2018

By Scott’s request, we are trying to corral all heavily culture war posts into one weekly roundup post. 'Culture war' is vaguely defined, but it basically means controversial issues that fall along set tribal lines. Arguments over culture war issues generate a lot of heat and little light, and few deeply entrenched people change their minds regardless of the quality of opposing arguments.

A number of widely read Slate Star Codex posts deal with Culture War, either by voicing opinions directly or by analysing the state of the discussion more broadly. Optimistically, we might agree that [being nice](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) really is worth your time, and so is [engaging with people you disagree with](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/).

More pessimistically, however, there are a number of dynamics that can lead discussions on Culture War topics to contain more heat than light. There's a human tendency to divide along tribal lines, praising your ingroup and vilifying your outgroup -- and if you think you find it easy to criticize your ingroup, then it may be that your outgroup is [not who you think it is](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/30/i-can-tolerate-anything-except-the-outgroup/). Extremists with opposing positions can [feed off each other](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/), highlighting each other's worst points to justify their own angry rhetoric, which becomes in turn a new example of bad behavior for the other side to highlight. We would like to avoid these dynamics.

Accordingly, we ask that you do not use this thread for waging the Culture War. Examples of waging the Culture War include:

- Shaming.
- Attempting to 'build consensus' or enforce ideological conformity.
- Making sweeping generalizations to vilify a group you dislike.
- Recruiting for a cause.
- Posting links that could be summarized as 'Boo outgroup!' Basically, if your content is 'Can you believe what Those People did this week?' then you should either refrain from posting, or do some very patient work to contextualize and/or steel-man the relevant viewpoint.

In general, we would prefer that you argue to understand, rather than arguing to win. This thread is not territory to be claimed by one group or another. Indeed, the aim is to have many different viewpoints represented here. Thus, we also ask that you:

- Speak plainly, avoiding sarcasm and mockery. When disagreeing with someone, state your objections explicitly.
- Be as precise and charitable as you can. Don't paraphrase unflatteringly.
- Don't imply that someone said something they did not say, even if you think it follows from what they said.
- Write like everyone is reading and you want them to be included in the discussion.

On an ad hoc basis, the mods will try to compile a list of the best posts/comments from the previous week. You may nominate a comment for this list by clicking on 'report' at the bottom of the post, selecting 'this breaks r/slatestarcodex's rules, or is of interest to the mods' from the pop-up menu and then selecting 'Actually a quality contribution' from the sub-menu.

"So I've taken it on myself to learn biology, having only had a pretty flimsy go at it in 9th grade--for all intents and purposes, I know nothing about the subject. 

On the other hand, I'm pretty skilled/experienced at most other subjects; I have a degree in math, and teach English, reading, science (including chemistry and physics, but excluding, of course, biology), writing, and various test prep stuff.

I've run into a problem with biology; unlike other hard sciences (I'm thinking especially of chemistry and physics), it seems pretty heavily reliant on rote memorization, and it seems difficult to put these into a coherent conceptual framework. 

With chemistry, you can figure out a lot by accepting a relatively small number of first principles regarding the properties of subatomic particles and inter-molecular forces. For example, the electronegativity trends conform (to a first approximation, at least) with intuitions based on the interactions between electrons and nuclei and valence shells.

In math, of course, pretty much everything up to a certain point makes sense intuitively based on how well you understand the first principles; in a sense, that's how we get new math, in a sense.

Even with something like history or literature, things seem to fit in naturally to our system, even though they're just facts, for the most part. It's not hard to learn about e.g. the war in the former Yugoslavia, even if you know nothing about the region, because the structure conforms to familiar principles (ethno-religious conflict, Balkanization, etc., etc.).

But biology, as far as I can tell, doesn't satisfy this property; I can't seem to locate the underlying principles. I think in this case, they're just too diffuse; the principles underlying cell respiration are different in kind than those underlying animal reproduction, for example, so maybe it just requires more principles?

But there are other groups of people who do not belong to those classes who get targeted by politicians.

Should we stop biking outside? Is limiting outdoor exposure worth it, even though it may make us more depressed and cause us to get less exercise? Is breathing air indoors without a purifier basically the same as breathing the air outdoors?

Do air purifiers actually work? Do particulate respirators actually work?

The only relevant study I can find is one that found a 0.64 year lifespan reduction from each 10-μg/m3 increase in PM10 (particulate matter under 10 microns). However, this is hard to compare to the data I'm getting from local pollution agencies, that seem to be tracking only PM2.5.

"Here is the excerpt:

“OK,” he says. “The whole principle is this: The guy wants to be a gentleman. He doesn’t want to be thought of as impolite, crude, or especially a cheapskate. As long as the girl knows the guy’s motives so well, it’s easy to steer him in the direction she wants him to go.

“Therefore,” he continued, “under no circumstances be a gentleman! You must disrespect the girls. Furthermore, the very first rule is, don’t buy a girl anything –– not even a package of cigarettes — until you’ve asked her if she’ll sleep with you, and you’re convinced that she will, and that she’s not lying.”

“Uh… you mean… you don’t… uh… you just ask them?”

“OK,” he says, “I know this is your first lesson, and it may be hard for you to be so blunt. So you might buy her one thing — just one little something — before you ask. But on the other hand, it will only make it more difficult.”

Well, someone only has to give me the principle, and I get the idea. All during the next day I built up my psychology differently: I adopted the attitude that those bar girls are all bitches, that they aren’t worth anything, and all they’re in there for is to get you to buy them a drink, and they’re not going to give you a goddamn thing; I’m not going to be a gentleman to such worthless bitches, and so on. I learned it till it was automatic.

Then that night I was ready to try it out. I go into the bar as usual, and right away my friend says, “Hey, Dick! Wait’ll you see the girl I got tonight! She had to go change her clothes, but she’s coming right back.”

“Yeah, yeah,” I say, unimpressed, and I sit at another table to watch the show. My friend’s girl comes in just as the show starts, and I’m thinking, “I don’t give a damn how pretty she is; all she’s doing is getting him to buy her drinks, and she’s going to give him nothing!”

After the first act my friend says, “Hey, Dick! I want you to meet Ann. Ann, this is a good friend of mine, Dick Feynman.”

I say “Hi” and keep looking at the show.

A few moments later Ann says to me, “Why don’t you come and sit at the table here with us?”

I think to myself, “Typical bitch: he’s buying her drinks, and she’s inviting somebody else to the table.” I say, “I can see fine from here.”

A little while later a lieutenant from the military base nearby comes in, dressed in a nice uniform. It isn’t long, before we notice that Ann is sitting over on the other side of the bar with the lieutenant!

Later that evening I’m sitting at the bar, Ann is dancing with the lieutenant, and when the lieutenant’s back is toward me and she’s facing me, she smiles very pleasantly to me. I think again, “Some bitch! Now she’s doing this trick on the lieutenant even!”

Then I get a good idea: I don’t look at her until the lieutenant can also see me, and then I smile back at her, so the lieutenant will know what’s going on. So her trick didn’t work for long.

A few minutes later she’s not with the lieutenant any more, but asking the bartender for her coat and handbag, saying in a loud, obvious voice, “I’d like to go for a walk. Does anybody want to go for a walk with me?”

I think to myself, “You can keep saying no and pushing them off, but you can’t do it permanently, or you won’t get anywhere. There comes a time when you have to go along.” So I say coolly, “I’ll walk with you.” So we go out. We walk down the street a few blocks and see a cafe, and she says, “I’ve got an idea — let’s get some coffee and sandwiches, and go over to my place and eat them.”

The idea sounds pretty good, so we go into the cafe and she orders three coffees and three sandwiches and I pay for them. As we’re going out of the cafe, I think to myself, “Something’s wrong: too many sandwiches!”

On the way to her motel she says, “You know, I won’t have time to eat these sandwiches with you, because a lieutenant is coming over…” I think to myself, “See, I flunked. The master gave me a lesson on what to do, and I flunked. I bought her $1.10 worth of sandwiches, and hadn’t asked her anything, and now I know I’m gonna get nothing! I have to recover, if only for the pride of my teacher.”

I stop suddenly and I say to her, “You… are worse than a WHORE!”

“Whaddya mean?”

“”You got me to buy these sandwiches, and what am I going to get for it? Nothing!”

“Well, you cheapskate!” she says. “If that’s the way you feel, I’ll pay you back for the sandwiches!”

I called her bluff: “Pay me back, then.”

She was astonished. She reached into her pocketbook, took out the little bit of money that she had and gave it to me. I took my sandwich and coffee and went off.

After I was through eating, I went back to the bar to report to the master. I explained everything, and told him I was sorry that I flunked, but I tried to recover.

He said very calmly, “It’s OK, Dick; it’s all right. Since you ended up not buying her anything, she’s gonna sleep with you tonight.”

“What?”

“That’s right,” he said confidently; “she’s gonna sleep with you. I know that.”

“But she isn’t even here! She’s at her place with the lieu —”

“It’s all right.”

Two o’clock comes around, the bar closes, and Ann hasn’t appeared. I ask the master and his wife if I can come over to their place again. They say sure. Just as we’re coming out of the bar, here comes Ann, running across Route 66 toward me. She puts her arm in mine, and says, “Come on, let’s go over to my place.”

The master was right. So the lesson was terrific!

When I was back at Cornell in the fall, I was dancing with the sister of a grad student, who was visiting from Virginia. She was very nice, and suddenly I got this idea: “Let’s go to a bar and have a drink,” I said.

On the way to the bar I was working up nerve to try the master’s lesson on an ordinary girl. After all, you don’t feel so bad disrespecting a bar girl who’s trying to get you to buy her drinks — but a nice, ordinary, Southern girl?

We went into the bar, and before I sat down, I said, “Listen, before I buy you a drink, I want to know one thing: Will you sleep with me tonight?”

“Yes.”

So it worked even with an ordinary girl! But no matter how effective the lesson was, I never really used it after that. I didn’t enjoy doing it that way. But it was interesting to know that things worked much differently from how I was brought up.

"Hi all

I'm trying to find an old post by scott from a few years back. 

The basic theme of the post was the issue where, when comparing options or candidates the gut instinct is to mentally create a matrix. 

Candidate A started a war and killed 100,000 people

Candidate B did minor thing 1, minor thing 2 and minor thing 3

So candidate A has 1 bad point and candidate B has 3 bad points 

But if we're being rational we should weight the big huge bad thing way more than even 50 of the small things.

"This is an idea that's been kicking around in my head, primarily around a few examples. It was inspired by [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vn1t9/what_are_the_most_undervalued_products_and/). That thread asked around what things do people not buy that they should - I'm more interested in things people *already* buy, that they pay a premium for due to low knowledge.

Essentially, what sort of premium do you pay for not having knowledge in one domain or another? Obviously quantifying knowledge here is hard, but I thought it was an interesting question to put to the community and see what answers arose in varying domains.

On a personal level, cars have been a big one for me. Basic stuff (like checking hoses for tautness, belts for cracking, foam in oil cap, etc, etc) when buying a car let me buy something very cheap for the price - simply by waiting, inspecting multiple used cars, and not buying those that didn't meet my fairly basic standards. I've had a reliable vehicle for 2 years for <$2k dollars (so approx $1500 USD) because of some fairly basic internalized domain knowledge. Conversely, most other people I know buying cars for reliability tend to be paying $10k upwards to ensure they're not buying a lemon. Given I spent maybe 7-10 hours checking out cars, this was a pretty spectacular return on my time.

Acquiring the knowledge itself was maybe 2-3 hours overall of some videos, a little bit of car maintenance, and occasionally going over a manual or two. 

That's a fairly common example, but I'd be curious for anything - anything more common (whitegoods, cars, housing) to the very esoteric. Ideally any responses can be denominated in either time or money - if you can roughly estimate a price for a piece of domain knowledge, all the better.

"My elevator told me today that the USPS operating deficit for 2018 was somewhere around $5 billion adding to a string of deficits as far back as I can recall. I couldn't find the article that tidbit came from, but here is [some](https://www.oversight.gov/sites/default/files/oig-reports/NO-AR-19-001.pdf)  color:

(OWC is the acronym for 'Operational Window Change' a program to reduce overhead and increase savings implemented in 2015, I think)

>What the OIG Found The Postal Service did not achieve its projected $1.61 billion OWC savings for fiscal years (FY) 2016 and 2017. Postal Service management identified savings of $275.25 million for FY 2016 and $17.22 million for FY 2017, or about 18 percent of the projected savings for both years. 

\[...\]

>Although management provided savings amounts for FYs 2016 and 2017, they qualified the saving amounts as being only estimates. They said they could not determine the actual amount of OWC savings achieved for FYs 2016 and 2017 because significant declines in letter and flats mail volume and increases in package volume “skewed” the data... Mail volume decreased by almost 5 billion pieces from FYs 2016 to 2017, making it more difficult for the Postal Service to achieve the OWC savings.  
>  
>Management said they remain optimistic they will achieve the full savings. However, we concluded that it is unlikely the Postal Service will ever achieve the projected annual $805.5 million OWC savings. The Postal Service did not develop an annual tracking methodology for each OWC savings category and did not develop a sensitivity analysis to account for changes in mail volume, changing labor cost, and transportation costs when they projected the OWC annual savings.   
>  
>Even though the Postal Service has not achieved its projected OWC savings, reverting to the previous operational window would likely cause further service disruption and additional cost. The OWC and the service standard revisions enabled the Postal Service to consolidate 17 mail processing facilities and partially consolidate another 21 facilities. Reestablishing the previous operating window could be cost prohibitive for the Postal Service.   
>  
>In addition to the OWC savings projections, the Postal Service projected annual transportation savings of over $268 million from network changes. However, transportation costs have increased by more than $1 billion, or 15.4 percent, since the OWC was implemented. Postal Service management said that transportation costs increased because the volume of packages require more space than other types of mail as well as higher driver contract rates. In the first year of the OWC, FCM single piece and commercial service scores decreased by over 11 and 4 percentage points. In addition, delayed mail increased to about 2.5 billion pieces in FY 2015. FCM service scores and delayed mail improved in FYs 2016 and 2017. However, in the first two quarters of FY 2018, FCM service scores decreased to where they were the year after the OWC and there were about 2.5 billion pieces of delayed mail.

&#x200B;

Pretty grim stuff. It seems the big takeaway is (aside from the USPS having some serious managerial issues) while there's an increase in packages, far fewer letters are being sent so the costs of transport are simply going up. It is very difficult for the USPS to compete with services like FED-EX and UPS.

First-class mail fell by $134 million, to $5.9 billion, while marketing (junk) mail rose by just $63 million to $3.9 billion.

&#x200B;

I'd like to reiterate this point:

>Unlike for-profit companies, the postal service has the mandate and the infrastructure to deliver in remote areas.

I think this is the crux of why the USPS is so important to the fabric of the US and why we so desperately need to figure out how to keep it around. The changes to its business practices seem important and while I'm not happy about the prospect of increased costs for mail, particularly for those in the under-served areas of the nation, I hope they work. What's more interesting to me are some ideas I've heard about adding a [banking component](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/senator-gillibrand-wants-the-u-s-postal-service-to-offer-retail-banking.html) to the post office as a way to help balance its budget *and* provide things like check-cashing services to the impoverished or those without bank accounts:

>The idea first surfaced in a [report from the Office of the Inspector General](https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2015/rarc-wp-14-007_0.pdf) in January 2014. The Postal Service could see $8.9 billion in new revenue annually from receiving 10 percent of the interest and fees being spent on non-bank transactions.  
>  
>Banks and credit unions would be well positioned to offer these services because of their ability to provide speed, ease and certainty, Horowitz said. Postal banking, on the other hand, would address the needs of the underbanked and unbanked populations.  
>  
>Some rural areas have post offices, but no bank or credit union branches, Pew found in its research.  
>  
>In addition to small-dollar loans, Gillibrand's postal bank legislation also includes other services including small dollar checking and savings accounts; transactional services including debit cards, cash machines, bill payments and online services; as well as domestic and international wire transfers.

&#x200B;

I do not know what the status is of [Gillibrand's bill](https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/news/press/release/gillibrand-announces-major-new-legislation-to-create-a-postal-bank-to-wipe-out-predatory-payday-lending-industry-practices-ensure-all-americans-have-access-to-basic-banking-services), nor do I have any notion of what the downsides might be, aside from competition with payday loan vendors.

&#x200B;

I'm wondering what other 'outside-the-box' ideas there are for shoring up this institution and arguments about if the USPS is even salvageable or worth saving (I think it is, but willing to hear counterarguments). I'd also be interested to hear if there's an Effective Altruism angle here . Perhaps the USPS could be instrumental in shepherding us into the UBI era?

&#x200B;

From my perspective the number of governmental and social institutions that unify the public seem to be dwindling. Some like shared media (ex. 3 tv channels, widely read newspapers, limited radio formats, etc.) have been supplanted by media gluts that make shared experiences less likely, particularly intergenerationally (ex. YouTube, streaming services, unlimited online news aggregators, Spotify playlists, etc.), others like the [military](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/10/army-accepting-more-low-quality-recruits-giving-waivers-marijuana-hit-targets/750844001/) or [civil service](https://www.fedsmith.com/2018/01/17/0-6-decrease-federal-employment-2017/) (n.b. most of the losses are from the Post Office!) are simply not drawing the people they need to thrive. Aside from sports, award shows, the IRS, rage toward Congress, and the USPS, there often doesn't seem like much unifies the American people any longer (note: I don't watch sports or award shows, so I'm used to being the outsider on this. I might be wrond. 

&#x200B;

Of course this is all based on my anecdotal experience, so I'm glad to hear thoughts to the contrary. For people outside of the US, does your country suffer from similar issue? Why or why not?

"I was at a gathering in which I encountered the jazz-hands-replacing-applause phenomena for the first time. It got me wondering about this new piece of social technology. It seems like something that came from progressive circles, and media seem to want to make it into a culture war issue ([link](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/02/clapping-replaced-jazz-hands-student-union-amid-fears-noise), [link](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/clapping-banned-jazz-hands-university-15223965)). I would like to have a rational discussion about it. 

From my perspective, deaf-inclusion and not-triggering-autistic-people seems like minor benefits, even if that's what media seems to talk about. I found jazz hands to be good in more direct ways:

1. People don't have to wait for the applause to die down before they can speak. This saves a surprisingly large amount of time. 

2. [Applause lights](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dLbkrPu5STNCBLRjr/applause-lights) are a lot less effective, since the speaker has to follow up their platitudes.

3. Debates becomes fairer since audience support matters less. 

4. Clapping too much hurts my hands. 

Clapping has some benefits, it's loud, impressive and feels nice. But I feel like jazz hands are useful as well. If I were Tzar, I would decree jazz hands as the default, especially at debates, decision meetings and such, and keep clapping reserved for rarer cases of mass celebration. 

So, what are your thoughts? Is jazz hands a useful piece of social technology or a progressive fad? ",Applause vs Jazz Hands,9x323i,new,127,82,82,0

He gives a great answer that essentially boils down to just because he perceived the Americans to be doing the wrong thing and essentially be the ""bad guys"", it doesn't mean that the communists and North Vietnamese were the ""good guys"".
