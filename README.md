#Project Proposal

The goal of this project is to help identify which areas of the internet, and specifically to start which areas of Reddit, are most and least supportive. I am using a labeled dataset that measures text toxicitiy, then applying it to score different Subreddits notorious for their good and bad behaviors. V1 will be a scorer of how toxic a subreddit is. V2 will try and create more nuanced ways to ban users.

I'll be scoring using F1 scores to show a balance of precision and recall.
