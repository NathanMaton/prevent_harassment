# Prevent Online Harassment

The goal of this project is to help identify which areas of the internet, and specifically to start which areas of Reddit, are safe. I am using a labeled dataset that measures text toxicitiy, then applying it to score different Subreddits notorious for their good and bad behaviors. Take a look at the [presentation](Presentation.pdf) and the notebooks that document my process.  

I used NLP techniques including TF-IDF word embeddings, visualization techniques including the t-SNE algorithm and a MongoDB to store the data from Reddit.
